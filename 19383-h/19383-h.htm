<h2 class="title">DESCRIPTIVE POETRY.</h2>
<h3 class="byline">BY A NEW CONTRIBUTOR.</h3>
<p><span class="first_word">Whatever</span> the poets may say, it is incontrovertible that the great
majority of men look upon the beauties and glories of Nature that surround
them with almost entire indifference. We shall not inquire
whether this is the result of a natural incapacity to perceive and admire
the beautiful and sublime, or whether it is that their impressions
are so deadened by familiarity as to be passed by unnoticed. Probably
the former is the case with the greater number; although we cannot
believe with some writers, that all our ideas of beauty are but the
results of association, or of our perceptions of the proportion, or fitness,
or utility of things. When we say that some things are naturally
agreeable, and others naturally disagreeable, we have said all that we
know about the matter; and this amounts to nothing more than a confession
of our ignorance. Yet, if we admit in all men the existence of
a natural sense of beauty, daily observation shows us that the pleasure
arising from it is in most cases very feeble and evanescent. How
many live in the midst of the most magnificent natural scenery, and
never perceive its beauties until they are pointed out to them by some
intelligent traveller! And often if admiration be professed, it is of that
vague, undistinguishing kind, which indicates little knowledge of the
causes why they admire. Even among men of cultivated tastes, there
is much more of affected than real enthusiasm.</p>

<p>If what we have said be true, it is a curious subject of inquiry why
descriptive poetry has been so popular. How happens it that so many
who have looked upon Nature herself with great indifference, have been
so much delighted with the reflection of her image in the pages of the
poets? We suspect, indeed, that a part of the popularity of this class
of writers is factitious. <span class="special_name">Thomson</span>, the most popular, is we suspect
oftener purchased than read; and his &#8216;Seasons&#8217; are not unfrequently
spoken of with admiration by those who know little of them but the
episodes. The chief interest of the &#8216;Task&#8217; is to be sought for in other
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2" name="page2"></a>2</span>sources than its descriptions, notwithstanding the <i>curiosa felicitas</i> of
Cowper&#8217;s diction.</p>

<p>The pleasure which we feel in reading descriptive poetry may perhaps
in all cases be traced to one of the three following sources: the conception
in our own minds of objects corresponding in a greater or less
degree to those which exist in the mind of the poet; the train of associations
which his language awakens; or the moral interest with which
he invests what he describes. In the case first mentioned, the emotions
we feel are similar to those which the sight of the objects themselves
would produce; if beautiful, of pleasure; if terrible, of awe. A
painting, which is an accurate representation of nature, regarded irrespective
of the skill of the artist, would affect us in the same way. But
the effects resulting from this cause are too inconsiderable to require
particular mention. The picture which words are able to present is so
indistinct and vague as rarely to produce any strong emotion. If the
objects themselves are generally looked upon with indifference, much
less can a verbal description of them afford us any great degree of
pleasure.</p>

<p>The language which the poet uses often suggests to the mind of the
reader trains of thought and imagery which were never present to his
own mind. Hence many expressions which are in themselves eminently
poetic, will arouse associations, oftentimes, that entirely spoil the passage.
On the other hand, an expression low and vulgar may be ennobled by
its associations, and give dignity and force to the composition. We not
unfrequently meet phrases which have great beauty in the eyes of one
man, which seem flat and insipid in the eyes of another. Every writer
who has attempted dignified or pathetic composition, has felt how difficult
it is to avoid those words which will suggest ideas that are unworthy of
the subject. If, however, the poet is sometimes a loser, he is also sometimes
a gainer from this cause. The reader often finds in his own associations,
sources of pleasure independent of the poet. The light that
illumines the page is but the reflected radiance of his own thoughts, and
is unseen by all save himself.</p>

<p>But it is in the moral interest with which the poet invests the objects
he describes, that the chief source of our pleasure is to be found. The
poet paints Nature, not as she is, but as she seems. He adorns her with
beauty not her own, and presents her thus adorned to men, to admire
and to love. It is by interweaving human sympathies and feelings with
the objects of the material world, that they lose their character of &#8216;mute
insensate things,&#8217; and acquire the power to charm and to soothe us,
amidst all the cares and anxieties of our life. The intellectual process
which here takes place is so interesting and important that we shall
make no apology for treating the subject at some length.</p>

<p>It is sufficiently obvious that an accurate description of nature, or a
beautiful work of art, is not poetical. On the other hand, in proportion
as the minuteness of the description is increased, the poetry vanishes.
The traveller who should give us the exact dimensions of the pyramids,
the precise height of the terraces, the width and height of the inner
passages, would give us much more definite ideas of those structures
than he who should paint to us the effects produced on his own mind by
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3" name="page3"></a>3</span>their vastness, their antiquity, and the solitude that surrounds them. So
in descriptions of natural scenery, the geographer who gives us the
measurement of mountains, and rivers, and plains, is much more accurate
than he who describes them solely from the picture that exists in his
fancy. We wish to be rightly understood. We do not mean that
vagueness and generality are essential to poetical description. As on
the one hand, mathematical accuracy, by allowing no play to the imagination,
produces a feeble impression, so on the other the indistinctness
arising from indefinite expressions is equally unfavorable. But in
neither is the poetry of the description dependent on the greater or less
degree of minuteness with which particular objects are spoken of.
When Whitbread described the Phenix, according to Sheridan&#8217;s version,
&#8216;like a poulterer; it was green, and red, and yellow, and blue; he did
not let us off for a single feather,&#8217; he did not fail more egregiously than
Thomson in the following lines, in which, by the force of language, a
flock of geese are made highly poetical objects:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i14">&#8216;Hushed in short suspense</p>
<p>The plumy people streak their wings with oil,</p>
<p>To throw the lucid moisture trickling off,</p>
<p>And wait the approaching sign to strike at once</p>
<p>Into the general choir.&#8217;</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The poet indeed must give us a lively and definite image of the scene
or object which he undertakes to describe. But how shall this be done?
Simply by telling us how it appeared to him; introducing those circumstances
which had the greatest effect on his own imagination. He looks
on nature neither as a gardener, a geographer, an astronomer, nor a
geologist, but as a man, susceptible of strong impressions, and able to
describe clearly to others the objects which affected himself. This he
will do in the style which the emotion raised within him naturally dictates.
His imagery, his illustrations, his whole language, will take the
hue of his own feelings. It is in describing accurately the effect, not
the cause, the emotion, not the object which produced it, that the poet&#8217;s
fidelity to nature consists. Let us illustrate our meaning by two or
three examples. In Thomson we find the following description of a
thunder-storm:</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i14">&#8216;A boding silence reigns</p>
<p>Dread through the dun expanse; save the dull sound</p>
<p>That from the mountain, previous to the storm,</p>
<p>Rolls o&#8217;er the muttering earth, disturbs the flood,</p>
<p>And shakes the forest leaf without a breath.</p>
<p>Prone to the lowest vale, the aÃ«rial tribes</p>
<p>Descend: the tempest-loving raven scarce</p>
<p>Dares wing the dubious dusk. In rueful gaze</p>
<p>The cattle stand, and on the scowling heavens</p>
<p>Cast a deploring eye, by man forsook,</p>
<p>Who to the crowded cottage hies him fast,</p>
<p>Or seeks the shelter of the downward cave.</p>
<p>&#8217;Tis listening fear, and dumb amazement all,</p>
<p>When to the startled eye the sudden glance</p>
<p>Appears far south, eruptive through the cloud</p>
<p>And following slower in explosion vast,</p>
<p>The thunder raises his tremendous voice.</p>
<p>At first heard solemn o&#8217;er the verge of heaven</p>
<p>The tempest growls; but as it nearer comes</p>
<p>And rolls its awful burthen on the wind,</p>
<p>The lightnings flash a larger curve, and more</p>
<p>The noise astounds; till over head a sheet</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page4" name="page4"></a>4</span>Of livid flame discloses wide; then shuts</p>
<p>And opens wider; shuts, and opens still</p>
<p>Expansive, wrapping ether in a blaze.</p>
<p>Follows the loosened, aggravated roar,</p>
<p>Enlarging, deepening, mingling; peal on peal</p>
<p>Crushed horrible, convulsing heaven and earth.&#8217;</p>
</div>
</div>


<p><span class="special_name">Mr. Irving</span> describes a similar scene in the following terms: &#8216;It
was the latter part of a calm sultry day, that they floated quietly with
the tide between these stern mountains. There was that perfect quiet
which prevails over nature in the languor of summer heat; the turning
of a plank, or the accidental falling of an oar on deck, was echoed from
the mountain side, and reverberated along the shores. To the left the
Dunderberg reared its woody precipices, height over height, forest over
forest, away into the deep summer sky. To the right strutted forth the
bold promontory of Antony&#8217;s nose, with a solitary eagle wheeling about
it; while beyond, mountain succeeded to mountain, until they seemed to
lock their arms together, and confine this mighty river in their embraces.
In the midst of his admiration, Dolph remarked a pile of bright snowy
clouds peering above the western heights. It was succeeded by another
and another, each seemingly pushing onward its predecessor, and towering
with dazzling brilliancy in the deep blue atmosphere; and now
muttering peals of thunder were faintly heard rolling behind the mountains.
The river, hitherto still and glassy, reflecting pictures of the
sky and land, now showed a dark ripple at a distance, as the breeze
came creeping up it. The fish-hawks wheeled and screamed, and
sought their nests on the high dry trees; the crows flew clamorously
to the crevices of the rocks, and all nature seemed conscious of the
approaching thunder gust. The clouds now rolled in volumes over
the mountain tops; their summits still bright and snowy, but the lower
parts of an inky blackness. The rain began to patter down in broad
and scattered drops; the winds freshened, and curled up the waves; at
length it seemed as if the bellying clouds were torn open by the mountain
tops, and complete torrents of rain came rattling down. The lightning
leaped from cloud to cloud, and streamed quivering against the
rocks, splitting and rending the stoutest forest trees; the thunder burst
in tremendous explosions; the peals were echoed from mountain to
mountain; they clashed upon Dunderberg, and then rolled up the long
defile of the Highlands, each headland waking a new echo, until old Bull
Hill seemed to bellow back the storm.&#8217;</p>

<p>We think that no one who attentively reads the foregoing extracts can
fail to see the infinite superiority of the latter over the former, in every
thing that pertains to a faithful representation of nature. Irving has
given us the scene just as he saw it, unmixed with any hue or coloring
with which the mood of his own mind might have invested it. We see
the objects themselves, disconnected from the associations of the spectator.
Had there been a thousand persons looking on, each would have
heard the same sounds, and seen the same sights. There is nothing
that is extraneous. He has given us an exact copy of his original, and
nothing more. Thomson, on the contrary, has not described a thunderstorm
as he saw it, but according to the effect that it produced on his own
mind. His epithets are rarely descriptive of the qualities that exist in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page5" name="page5"></a>5</span>the objects to which they are applied. They have reference rather to
the emotions which their presence produces in himself. Thus, in the
first line, &#8216;boding&#8217; is not a quality that can be predicated of silence.
To the feeling that the silence preceding a storm is wont to excite, the
epithet is properly enough applied. So with the expression &#8216;dubious
dusk.&#8217;</p>

<p>In connection with these extracts, we will look at one taken from
<span class="special_name">Scott&#8217;s</span> description of the scenery around Loch Katrine:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&#8216;Boon nature scattered free and wild,</p>
<p>Each plant, or flower, the mountain&#8217;s child;</p>
<p>Here eglantine embalmed the air,</p>
<p>Hawthorn and hazel mingled there;</p>
<p>The primrose pale, and violet flower,</p>
<p>Found in each cleft a narrow bower;</p>
<p>Foxglove and night-shade, side by side</p>
<p>Emblems of punishment and pride,</p>
<p>Grouped their dark hues with every stain</p>
<p>The weather-beaten crags retain;</p>
<p>With boughs that quaked at every breath,</p>
<p>Gray-birch and aspen wept beneath;</p>
<p>Aloft the ash and warrior oak</p>
<p>Cast anchor in the rifted rock;</p>
<p>And higher yet the pine tree hung</p>
<p>His scattered trunk, and frequent flung</p>
<p>Where seemed the cliffs to meet on high</p>
<p>His boughs athwart the narrowed sky.</p>
<p>Highest of all, where white peaks glanced,</p>
<p>Where glistening streamers waved and danced,</p>
<p>The wanderer&#8217;s eye could barely view</p>
<p>The summer heaven&#8217;s delicious blue.&#8217;</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The same remarks which we applied to Irving are applicable with
some little restriction here. With one or two exceptions, the epithets
mark attributes that exist in the subjects. Every one can see at a
glance the appropriateness of such terms as <em>pale</em> primrose, <em>gray</em> birch,
and <em>narrow</em> bower. They are not dependent for their effect upon any
fanciful train of associations which their names may excite.</p>

<p>If we compare the above extracts together, we arrive at certain results
which we shall briefly state. We will throw out of view for a
moment any pleasure which the rhythm may give us, as foreign to our
present purpose. Each of these writers is describing a scene from
nature. Each of them has the same object, to interest others by a representation
of those sights and sounds that interested themselves. Scott
accomplishes his purpose by presenting as exact a picture of nature as it
is possible perhaps for words to give. He does not tell us how he is
affected by what he sees, and looks upon neither directly nor indirectly.
He does not search for any resemblances that are not palpable, and
founded in the nature of things. All similes and metaphors which serve
to express his own emotions are carefully avoided. The whole is picturesque
and life-like in the highest degree, yet every circumstance is
mentioned in the cool, unimpassioned way in which we mention any
common occurrence.</p>

<p>Thomson accomplishes his purpose by portraying his own feelings;
not indeed in so many words, but by the use of those expressions, and by
those transitions of thought, which mark a state of emotion. The epithet
&#8216;boding,&#8217; to which we have referred, is an example. It is an indirect
disclosure of the mood of his own mind. At another time it is not improbable
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page6" name="page6"></a>6</span>that an epithet of a directly opposite meaning would have been
selected. The reader is affected by it, because by a law of sympathy,
we are affected by whatever reveals the presence of passion in another.
It influences us precisely as the tones of the voice of a person in distress
influence us. Both are expressive of emotion, and we cannot remain
unaffected by them.</p>

<p>This is the main source of the pleasure we feel in reading Thomson's
description. It conveys to us but a very indistinct idea of the subject
matter. Different readers, according to their mental peculiarities, will
be differently affected by it. He does not paint to the bodily eye, but to
the eye of the mind; and he will feel most pleasure who puts himself
in the same position as the poet, and sees with his eyes and hears
with his ears. Unless he can do this, he will derive but little gratification
from the perusal.</p>

<p>Less minute than Irving, and more picturesque than Thomson, Scott
will probably to most readers give more pleasure than either of them.
In conveying lively impressions of natural objects he is unsurpassed,
but he is scarcely less successful in inspiring the mind of the reader
with the same emotions that fill his own breast. There is ever between
the thought and its expression a perfect harmony. It is only when agitated
by passion that he uses the <em>language</em> of passion. Hence we never
find that timid phraseology which so often disgusts us in Thomson; <i>vox
et prÃ¦terea nihil</i>. No one delights more in the use of figurative language,
nor employs metaphors that more appropriately convey the sentiment
that pervades his mind. In the passage we have quoted are the following
lines:</p>

<p>&#8216;Aloft the ash and warrior oak</p>
<p>Cast anchor in the rifted rock.&#8217;</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The poet looking up at the trees firmly rooted in the rifts of the rock,
defying the tempest and storm, felt an emotion of pleasure which the
sight of their lofty position, and the apparent danger of their being hurled
headlong at the first blast of wind, contrasted with the sense of their
real security, produced. To express this pleasurable emotion, he fastens
upon the resemblance between a root of the tree and an anchor; a
resemblance not between the things themselves, but between their uses.
Neglecting all the points of difference, and confining his attention to this
single point of similarity, he presents an image which all admit to be
highly forcible and poetical.</p>

<p>The great merit of all descriptive poetry consists in the unity of feeling
which pervades it. Unlike the epic, or the drama, it has none of
the interest which arises from a connected narrative, or the development
of individual character in reference to a certain end. The poet confines
himself to the expression of those feelings which are awakened
by the sight of the beauty and sublimity of nature. Passing, as he
necessarily must, from one object to another, each fitted to excite in his
bosom conflicting emotions, his attention is so much diverted, that none
of them produces upon him its legitimate effect. There is wanting
some central object of interest to which all others are subordinate.
Hence is explained the listlessness of which every one is conscious in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page7" name="page7"></a>7</span>the continuous perusal of the Seasons. We find the greatest pleasure
by reading a page here and a page there, according to the state of our
feelings.</p>

<p>It is never in short poems that the descriptive poets succeed best.
L&#8217;Allegro and Le Penseroso are gems; but all Milton&#8217;s genius could
not have made the Paradise Lost readable, were it deprived of its unity
as an epic, and broken up into a series of detached pictures. The Deserted
Village of Goldsmith is the longest poem of this class that we
now remember, having all its parts so pervaded by a common spirit that
a succession of new objects does not impair the designed effect. Sweet
Auburn as it was in its palmy days, and as it is in its desolation, presents
two distinct pictures, yet so closely connected that each heightens
the effect of the other by the contrast. Nothing can exceed the exquisite
art with which Goldsmith has seized upon those circumstances
that tend to make the desired impression, and rejected all others.
How perfect are each of the following descriptions, and how much would
their beauty be marred by the transfer of a single circumstance from
one to the other:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&#8216;How often have I paused on every charm,</p>
<p>The sheltered cot, the cultivated farm;</p>
<p>The never-failing brook, the busy mill,</p>
<p>The decent church that topped the neighb&#8217;ring hill;</p>
<p>The hawthorn-bush with seats beneath the shade,</p>
<p>For talking age and whispering lovers made.</p>
</div>
<p class="poetry_break">&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p>&#8216;The dancing pair that simply sought renown,</p>
<p>By holding out to tire each other down;</p>
<p>The swain mistrustless of his smutted face,</p>
<p>While secret laughter tittered round the place;</p>
<p>The bashful virgin&#8217;s sidelong looks of love,</p>
<p>The matron&#8217;s glance, that would those looks reprove.</p>
</div>
<p class="poetry_break">&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p>&#8216;No more thy glassy brook reflects the day,</p>
<p>But choked with sedges works its weedy way;</p>
<p>Along thy glade, a solitary guest,</p>
<p>The hollow-sounding bittern guards its nest;</p>
<p>Amidst thy desert walks the lapwing flies,</p>
<p>And tires the echoes with unvaried cries;</p>
<p>Sunk are thy bowers, in shapeless ruin all,</p>
<p>And the long grass o&#8217;ertops the mouldering wall.&#8217;</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is by the selection of such objects as have in themselves no common
bond of union, but which combine to raise a certain emotion, that
the essential distinction is to be found between the descriptions of the
poet and the prose-writer. The latter joins objects together as they are
joined in nature, following a principle of association which is simple
and obvious. His resemblances are usually such as are cognizable by
the senses; a likeness in the sensible qualities of things. The poet&#8217;s
principle of association is in the effect produced on his imagination.
Things which have not in themselves a single point of similarity, are
connected together, because they produce the same emotions of pleasure,
or pain, or hope, or melancholy. A beautiful illustration of this is
found in the opening stanzas of Gray&#8217;s Elegy:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&#8216;The curfew tolls the knell of parting day,</p>
<p>The lowing herd winds slowly o&#8217;er the lea,</p>
<p>The ploughman homeward plods his weary way,</p>
<p>And leaves the world to darkness and to me.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight,</p>
<p>And all the air a solemn stillness holds,</p>
<p>Save where the beetle wheels his droning flight,</p>
<p>And drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds.&#8217;</p>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page8" name="page8"></a>8</span>A summer evening in the country is associated in most minds with
images of mirth and joy. Thus Goldsmith has described it:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&#8216;Sweet was the sound, when oft at evening&#8217;s close,</p>
<p>Up yonder hill the village murmur rose;</p>
<p>There as I passed with careless steps, and slow,</p>
<p>The mingling notes came softened from below;</p>
<p>The swain responsive as the milk-maid sung,</p>
<p>The sober herd that lowed to meet their young;</p>
<p>The noisy geese that gabbled o&#8217;er the pool,</p>
<p>The playful children just let loose from school,</p>
<p>The watch-dog&#8217;s voice, that bayed the whisp&#8217;ring wind,</p>
<p>And the loud laugh that spoke the vacant mind.&#8217;</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>With what consummate skill, if indeed it be not rather the instinct of
the poet, has Gray avoided all mention of those objects which might
awaken associations discordant with the mood of his own mind! Each
epithet is full of a plaintive melancholy. There is not one that does
not contribute something to the effect; not one that can be omitted; not
one that can be altered for the better. Yet there is scarcely one that is
descriptive of any quality actually existing in its subject. The fitness
of each is to be felt rather than seen.</p>

<p>In the selection of those circumstances and objects which Gray has
enumerated, he was governed by the effect which each had upon his
own feelings. He looked upon nature in the reflected light of his own
heart. He was mournful in view of the destiny of man; and wandering
amidst the graves of the lowly and obscure, he saw all the external
world colored with the hue of his own sad thoughts. The melancholy
spirit within him transformed all things without into its own likeness.
His imagination, darting hither and thither, and governed in its flight by
laws too subtle and delicate to be analyzed, reposed itself for a moment
amidst the gloom of the historical associations that cluster around the
curfew, hovered over the lowing herd, and followed the ploughman as
he homeward plods his weary way. Goldsmith, recalling the scenes
where he had spent many happy hours, looks upon nature under a far
different aspect. Every thing to him is gay and joyous. He hears not
the hollow tones of the curfew, nor the drowsy tinklings that lull the distant
folds. He sees not the wearied ploughman, caring for nought but
to forget his toils in the sweet oblivion of sleep. He hears but the song
of the milk-maid, and the soft response of her rustic lover; the watchdog&#8217;s
voice, and the loud laugh of the happy idlers. He sees but the
children just escaped from school, running and leaping, and romping in
their innocent glee. Happy himself, he fastens upon whatever in nature
around him seems to sympathise with him, and dwelling fondly upon it,
casts away from his thoughts every thing that can obstruct the full, free
flow of his joyous emotions.</p>

<p>We may remark in passing, what has probably been before remarked
by the attentive reader, that both Gray and Goldsmith, excited as they
are by different passions, refer to the &#8216;lowing herd&#8217; as raising on the
one hand a cheerful, and on the other a melancholy feeling. To our
thought, the associations connected with the return of the herds from the
fields at sunset are best fitted to awaken that quiet, reflective state of
mind which is most congenial to the mood of the elegiac poet. To
another, these associations may be of such a character as to produce a
directly opposite effect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page9" name="page9"></a>9</span>The writer of prose who should describe scenes like these, would aim
to give us a distinct and accurate picture by presenting all their prominent
features, omitting nothing, and grouping them as Nature herself had
grouped them. Such descriptions we daily see in all books of voyages
and travels. Or if the descriptions be of scenes wholly imaginary,
their essential character is not changed. Although they cease to be
real, they do not become poetical. The extract which we have made
from Irving is not poetical. Accurate, vivid, life-like, it is. We cannot
read it without a feeling of pleasure. We admire the genius of the
writer; we wonder at the magnificence of the spectacle which, by a
few masterly touches, he has raised up before us. But there is no
more poetry in it than in his description of Herr Van Tassel&#8217;s supper
table, covered with all the luxuries of Dutch housewifery. It is true,
there may be more of beauty and sublimity in the scenery of the Hudson,
in the gathering clouds and muttering thunder, than in the sight of
dough-nuts and crullers, sweet-cakes and short-cakes, peach pies and
pumpkin pies, slices of ham and slices of smoked beef; yet the spirit
of poetry exists no more in the one than in the other. Poetry has its
abode in the <em>heart</em> of man; not in the winds, in the clouds, in the
mountains, or in the vales. It does not derive its power from the outward
world, but breathes into it its own breath of life, investing the
earth with a beauty which has no existence but in the human soul, and
filling the air with sweet harmonies, which are unheard save by the
inspired ear of the poet.</p>

<p>We have now, we think, sufficiently answered the question, why so
many who read descriptive poetry with pleasure, look with indifference
upon what is beautiful or sublime in nature. The poet is to them like
one who gives sight to the blind. The landscape which formerly lay
before their eyes unregarded, almost unseen, is now &#8216;beautiful exceedingly.&#8217;
Nature has not changed; they themselves have not changed;
yet there <em>is</em> a change. There is a glory unseen before, cast over the
earth. It is, as it were, transfigured before them, and made radiant
with celestial light. This is the poet&#8217;s work. With a keener perception
of the beautiful and sublime than other men; with a greater facility
of association, and with the power to give to language the hue and
intensity of his own feelings, he clothes lifeless nature with the attributes
of humanity, making it instinct with human sentiment and passion.
Like Burns, he pours forth his lament over the mountain-daisy cut down
in its bloom, in a few simple words that find a response in the hearts of
all men; and henceforth it is embalmed in our memories, and shall be as
immortal as the star that shines in the far depths of the heavens. Like
Wordsworth, he wanders upon the banks of his native lakes, and mingles
his song with the noise of their waters, until the faintest whisper of
the rippling waves seems but the echo of his voice. Wherever he goes
fruits, flowers, and herbage spring up in his footsteps. A divine
Presence goes with him; Nature speaks to him with her thousand voices,
and he hears, and answers, making sweet music in the joy of his heart.
Nothing is so inconsiderable as to be without the pale of his sympathy;
nothing too humble to stir the fountains of love in his breast. The solitary
flower that blossoms by the way-side, the rivulet far away amid the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page10" name="page10"></a>10</span>hills, is but the starting point of that wondrous chain of thick-coming
fancies, that fill his eyes with light, and his ear with harmony; as if
multitudes of angels were hovering around, and he heard on every side
the rustling of their wings.</p>

<p>Such are the gifts of the poet. They are God&#8217;s gifts, and are indeed
&#8216;wonderful in our eyes.&#8217;</p>

<h2 class="title">THE IDLEBERG PAPERS.</h2>
<h3 class="subtitle">A CHRISTMAS YARN.</h3>
<p><span class="first_word">At</span> Christmas every body is or should be happy. The genial influence
of the season lightens alike the lofty hall and the lowly cottage.
It is the same at home or abroad, on the land or the billow, in royal purple
or in ragged poverty; here and every where, to one and to all, it is
always &#8216;merrie Christmas.&#8217; At such a time there is an obligation due
from every man to society, to be happy, and the more cheerfully it is
paid, the better. The man who would be found scowling and glowering
like a thunder-cloud, cherishing his private griefs or animosities at a
time when every other countenance is glowing with light, and hope, and
sunshine, should be denied all the charities of humanity, and exiled to
Kamschatka, or some other inhospitable clime, to growl and fret with the
wild beasts, or the wilder elements.</p>

<p>How dear is the light of home when glowing with the fires of Christmas!
What though the elements be wild without, or Jack Frost blow
his whistling pipe at the door, or fierce winds rumble down the chimney,
and tell of sweeping gusts and howling storms abroad, if within and
around that charmed circle is breathed the spirit of kindness and affection!
Should the titled stranger or the ragged beggar knock, throw wide open
the doors of thy hospitality; and while prattling infants recount the joys
of the season, and school-boy striplings pursue their holiday sports, and
gray-haired men who have traversed the wide world over, tell how in
all their wanderings they have never passed a Christmas from home;
he will turn his thoughts with a melancholy pleasure to the distant fireside
beyond the sea, and to the friends who are gathered there, and wonder
where the wanderer is spending his Christmas.</p>

<p>With all respect for the ancient and honorable class of &#8216;old bachelors,&#8217;
whose sympathy and good fellowship we most earnestly desire,
be it said, that if to any it is allowed to be miserable at Christmas,
it surely is to them. We would not for the world say aught to heighten
the sad picture of their social desolation, by dwelling on the thousand tender
endearments of home, the ten thousand cords of love, of which they
know nothing. Certain it is, that to many of them &#8216;merrie Christmas&#8217;
brings only pangs of remorse; and we have known more than one
crusty member of the fraternity, who on such occasions would rush incontinently
from the scene and the sound of merriment, and shut themselves
under lock and key, until the storm was passed, and people have
recovered their lost senses.</p>

<p>Such an one, however, we are proud to say, was <em>not</em> <span class="special_name">Tom Hardesty</span>,
though bachelor he was, in the superlative degree. Every body wondered
how he managed to preserve his good-humor and vivacity under the
frosts of three-score winters. At the period of this authentic history,
Tom was the village grocer; a station he had filled to his own profit
and the town&#8217;s convenience until he had become a piece of village furniture,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page12" name="page12"></a>12</span>necessary to its existence as a corporation. His little store, with
its great variety of commodities, adapted to every human want, was in
itself a perfect &#8216;curiosity-shop.&#8217; Odd-looking boxes, kegs, chests,
casks, barrels and hogsheads, contained his groceries, drugs and dye-stuffs.
A few remnants of domestic prints and muslins, together with
stray fragments of broadcloth, constituted his stock of dry-goods. Then
there was a modicum of hardware and cutlery; a few spelling-books
and new testaments for a book store; and sundry jars and bottles filled
with fancy-colored powders and liquids, for an apothecary shop. His
remaining list of commodities was made up of hats, caps and bonnets,
boots and shoes, tin-pans and looking-glasses, slate-pencils and sifters;
and as his standing advertisement in the village newspaper duly notified
the public, &#8216;other articles too numerous to mention&#8212;call and see for
yourselves.&#8217; If any body desired an article nobody ever heard of before,
he could find a large lot thereof at Tom Hardesty&#8217;s; and if any
lucky or ingenious wight had found or made any thing that nobody else
would have as a gracious gift, let him call on Mr. Hardesty, and it was
the very thing he wanted. In a word, his shop was a grand dÃ©pÃ´t for
every article the ingenuity of man could devise, or his necessities require.</p>

<p>What a blessed convenience was Tom Hardesty! How could we have
gotten along without him? How honest and affable! What long ells
and heavy pounds he gave! And then his tea! how it inspired the
village gossip on long winter nights in a chimney corner! All the
matrons of the village were quite in love with Tom, or his tea; and
many an old crone, as she sat inhaling cup after cup of the divine beverage,
has been known to pause in the midst of her inspirations, and
exclaim with uplifted hands, &#8216;God bless Tom Hardesty!&#8217;</p>

<p>And yet Tom Hardesty was a bachelor, and kept &#8216;bachelor&#8217;s hall.&#8217;
The only members of his mess were an orphan boy of his adoption,
who waited in the store, and a brindle cat which the master had honored
with his own name. This point, however, is still wrapt in obscurity,
for Tom and &#8216;Tom&#8217; were both so venerable that nobody could swear
whether the cat had been named after the master, or the master after
the cat. It had been rumored by those who should know, that Mr.
Hardesty should not be held strictly accountable for this sin of celibacy,
since he had offered his hand, his heart, and a partnership in his worldly
goods, to more than one village beauty, each of whom had found it
impossible to &#8216;love for antiquity&#8217;s sake,&#8217; and rejected his matrimonial
offers accordingly. Still Tom never repined. His daily experience
behind the counter had taught him the useful lesson, that each applicant
does not necessarily always drive a trade, and the commodity which
one rejects may be eagerly sought by another; and acting on the faith of
this philosophy, he lived cheerfully on, cherishing the hope that even yet
some fond heart would beat responsive to his own, and promise before
the competent authority, to &#8216;love, honor and obey&#8217; him, Tom Hardesty.</p>

<p>On a memorable Christmas-eve we enter his little counting-room. A
cheerful fire blazes on the hearth; and at the moment grimalkin is
purring on the rug. Master John, the adopted, is poring over a picture-book,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page13" name="page13"></a>13</span>probably an early edition of Peter Parley&#8217;s Travels, and Mr.
Hardesty is standing before a broken fragment of looking-glass, diligently
brushing his scanty locks.</p>

<p>&#8216;John!&#8217; said Mr. Hardesty, turning from the mirror, and looking full
at the boy, &#8216;do I look very old to-night?&#8217;</p>

<p>The boy turned up his innocent face, gazed steadily on his master
from top to toe, and answered, &#8216;Sir!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Do I look very <em>old</em> to-night, John?&#8217;</p>

<p>John scratched his head. &#8216;Not much older than you did this time
last night, Sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Humph!&#8217; said Mr. Hardesty, appealing to the glass, and renewing
his efforts with the brush, while John resumed his reading.</p>

<p>&#8216;But, John,&#8217; resumed Mr. Hardesty, seating himself beside the boy,
&#8216;do you really think that a middle-aged lady, of right comfortable property,
would have, <em>could</em> have, any rational objection to be called Mrs.
Hardesty?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I think not, Sir,&#8217; replied John, taking up the cat; &#8216;I&#8217;m sure you have
been very kind to me and old Tom here, and I know you would be so to
her.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Very true, John,&#8217; said Mr. Hardesty, whose feelings were touched
by this expression of the boy&#8217;s gratitude; &#8216;but I wish to extend the
sphere of my usefulness; and I may venture to hope&#8212;but don&#8217;t mention
it&#8212;that in the course of three or four years, or may-be a little
longer, there&#8217;ll be a little boy at our house for you to play with; and if
it&#8217;s a girl, John, you shall marry her when you get old enough. Eh,
John! how would you like <em>that</em>?&#8217; And the old gentleman chuckled
himself into a fit of coughing that seemed to threaten his longevity, and
prevented John&#8217;s reply to a suggestion that had never occurred to him
as being within the bounds of the most remote possibility.</p>

<p>Having amused himself sufficiently with these flights of his fancy,
Mr. Hardesty rose from his seat, gave John eighteen-pence for Christmas-money,
stroked his namesake&#8217;s back, put on his cloak and cap, and
after bidding John be a good boy, and not to mention it, and to take care
of the fire till he came back, left the house on his errand of love.</p>

<p>Christmas eve! Surely the village streets were never so gay before!
You may know there is a moon, for though the sky is darkened with
clouds, and the snow is falling as it never fell before, there is a glow of
light above and around, that would burst on the eye like dim revealings
of fairy-land, but for the mist that floats through the dim upper air, and
seems striving to bind the earth as with a mantle.</p>

<p>What a merry, merry Christmas! Gust after gust comes whirling
on, full-freighted with the virgin snow. There are shouts of revelry
that rise and fall with the sound of the blast. There are hurried footsteps
that glide over the crackling snow. There are merry hearts
within those bounding sleighs, and hands that clasp the hands they love,
though wrapped in countless furs and muffs. Gay steeds dash on with
steaming nostrils, as if their toil were sport; and their bells, as they ring
cheerily out in the sombre night, give promise of marriage-bells to
come.</p>

<p>Through all this busy scene Tom Hardesty pressed on, turning neither
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page14" name="page14"></a>14</span>to the right nor left, except when he turned a corner. As the wind
dashed the driving snow in his face, he drew his cloak more closely
around him, and, shivering, passed on with cheerful thoughts of love
and matrimony. Sometimes the boys pelted him with their snowy
artillery, or old acquaintances inquired after his health, but he glided
on like a dim shadow, heedless alike of all. By degrees the holiday
din of the village waxed faint in his ears, and as he approached the
suburbs, his heart beat fast while his steps were slow with indecision,
for he was approaching the end of his pilgrimage&#8212;the dwelling of Miss
Peggy Sidebottom.</p>

<p>While Mr. Hardesty is pausing at the door, stamping the snow from
his feet, and making the accustomed use of his pocket-handkerchief, we
will take advantage of his delay to state, briefly, that Miss Sidebottom,
beside being sole proprietress of the cottage-like mansion aforesaid,
claimed also among her chattels sundry shares in bank, and certain
notes of hand, yielding her sufficient income, without calculating the
value of her personal charms, to make her hand and heart two very
desirable items of furniture in a bachelor&#8217;s apartments. Her household
consisted of herself, and a nephew and niece, christened Dick and
Belinda, orphan children of a deceased brother. Dick was a wild,
rattling scape-grace, as ever robbed hen-roost or melon-patch; Belinda
was nothing, particularly, except a little, quiet, blue-eyed girl, the pride
of her aunt, and a pattern of propriety to all little girls. That Miss
Sidebottom was kind and motherly to the two orphans, there is no question;
but it was rumored that in consideration thereof she enjoyed a
comfortable legacy. It is only necessary to premise, farther, that Miss
Sidebottom had been younger by some two-score years than she was that
night; that she was one of Mr. Hardesty&#8217;s best customers; and that
after long worshipping her across the counter, he had suddenly determined
to declare his passion with all the eloquence he possessed; which
was not inconsiderable, as many can bear witness.</p>

<p>Mr. Hardesty knocks and is admitted to the hall. Another door is
opened, and there, in the snuggest corner, and by the snuggest fire conceivable,
sits Miss Sidebottom. The opposite end of the hearth is
decorated by Belinda, while a cat is sleeping on the rug between them.
It was a picture of quiet happiness that touched Mr. Hardesty&#8217;s heart;
and advancing into the room, he bows with all the elegance of a Beau
Brummel.</p>

<p>Miss Sidebottom turned her eyes upon the new-comer, and as they
fell on the familiar and smiling countenance of the grocer, she sprang
to her feet, and exclaimed: &#8216;Why, Mr. Hardesty! I am so glad to see
you! Let me have your cloak and cap, Sir. Come, be seated; draw
near the fire.&#8217;</p>

<p>Mr. Hardesty kept bowing all this time with as much nobility as
was displayed by the famous stick that was too crooked to lie still; and
after grasping Belinda&#8217;s hand very affectionately, he seated himself, and
drew near the fire.</p>

<p>&#8216;Dear me! what a night!&#8217; said Miss Sidebottom; &#8216;ain&#8217;t it cold out,
Mr. Hardesty?&#8217;</p>

<p>Mr. Hardesty replied by shivering palpably, and said he had seen
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page15" name="page15"></a>15</span>colder, and he had seen warmer, but it would do. Having said thus
much, he produced his snuff-box, which he extended to the ladies, and
then helped himself.</p>

<p>&#8216;I am truly glad, Miss Peggy,&#8217; continued Tom. &#8216;to see you situated
so comfortably&#8212;I am.&#8217; And he smiled tenderly and shifted his chair;
but in doing so, he infringed on the cat&#8217;s tail, and the animal, as cats
are wont to do, squalled vehemently. Mr. Hardesty bounded from his
seat.</p>

<p>&#8216;Dear me!&#8217; exclaimed Miss Sidebotton, &#8216;don&#8217;t do that!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Positively, Madam,&#8217; said Tom, &#8216;I am very sorry, indeed&#8212;I am!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Poor thing!&#8217; said Belinda, taking the injured quadruped in her arms;
&#8216;poor thing!&#8212;did he hurt its tail?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;&#8217;Deed, Madam,&#8217; said Mr. Hardesty, stroking the animal&#8217;s back, &#8216;I
wouldn&#8217;t have done that for forty ordinary cats. I may say, Madam,
speaking metaphorically, that your cat is of the short-horn Durham
stock, and wasn&#8217;t made to be trod on.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Lor&#8217;, Sir,&#8217; replied Miss Sidebottom, adjusting her cap, &#8216;cats is cats,
and cattle is cattle&#8212;that&#8217;s my sentiments; but as I was going to say,
Mr. Hardesty, I was telling Mrs. Jenkins to-night, not an hour ago, that
I felt a kind of nervous kind of feeling that somebody was coming; and
sure enough, here comes you. You see, Mrs. Jenkins was here to take
tea with me to-night, and beside the baby, why her little Jack and Sally
and Bill and Susan <em>would</em> come, because, they said, pap wasn&#8217;t at home,
and they would starve if they staid there. And here, sure enough,
come they did, before Mrs. Jenkins had fairly pulled off her bonnet;
and stay they would, though she boxed &#8217;em well; but they didn&#8217;t mind
that, and I told her Christmas come but once a year, and as it turned
out, the poor things <em>were</em> hungry, in yearnest. And you never see
children eat so; I do believe they hadn&#8217;t had a good meal for a fortnight.
Well, we hadn&#8217;t got fairly seated after supper, when rap! rap!
at the door, and there was Jake Crow had come for Mrs. Jenkins; for
Jenkins had got into a drunken row, and had his head cut with a stick.
And you never hearn sich a fuss; and Mrs. Jenkins and the little brats
went home crying all the way; and here me and Belinda have been by
ourselves ever since. But poor Mrs. Jenkins! I wonder men will get
drunk and leave their wives and children to starve. <em>You</em> never get
drunk, Mr. Hardesty, do you?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Drunk! Madam, drunk!&#8217; said Mr. Hardesty, placing his hand over
his heart, and shaking his head emphatically. &#8216;No, Madam; I only
get what you may call intoxicated, and not with liquor neither; and I
feel it coming on me now&#8212;I do indeed!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, well!&#8217; replies Mrs. Sidebottom, holding up her hands in utter
astonishment, &#8216;I never heard tell of the like of that before. P&#8217;raps its
the cold, Mr. Hardesty.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No, Madam,&#8217; persisted the old gentleman; &#8216;it&#8217;s the heat.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Dear me! Mr. Hardesty; then I&#8217;ll open the door.&#8217; And Miss Peggy
started to her feet.</p>

<p>&#8216;No, my dear Madam, don&#8217;t, if you please. It ain&#8217;t this here fire in
the hearth, but,&#8217; striking his breast passionately, &#8216;it&#8217;s <em>here</em>, Madam.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;That&#8217;s just where Mrs. Jenkins is affected sometimes, and she says
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page16" name="page16"></a>16</span>Madeira&#8217;s the best thing for it; and she has drank nearly all that last
quart I got of you, Mr. Hardesty, and I don&#8217;t see as she gets any better.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Madeira, indeed!&#8217; said old Tom, scornfully. &#8216;Madeira, madam,
instead of squenching, would only add fuel to the flame that is consuming
me. There <em>are</em> men as takes to the bottle for it when they despair;
but bless your soul!&#8217; he continued, dropping his voice to a whisper,
&#8216;I haven&#8217;t despaired.&#8217;</p>

<p>At this eloquent appeal, Mrs. Sidebottom looked at the fire and said
nothing, until an audible snore from Belinda, who had fallen asleep in
her chair, aroused her.</p>

<p>&#8216;Bless me!&#8217; exclaimed Miss Peggy, bouncing to her feet; &#8216;look at
the child there! Belinda dear, wake up. Poor dear thing! you had
better go up stairs to bed.&#8217; And rubbing her eyes, the child took up a
lighted candle, bowed politely to Mr. Hardesty, and disappeared behind
the stair-door.</p>

<p>Miss Sidebottom resumed her seat and looked again at the fire, and
Mr. Hardesty looked at Miss Sidebottom. Presently, that amiable lady
turned her gaze, lighted as it was by an equivocal smile, full upon
Tom. In the space of about fifteen seconds, after trying in vain to interpret
that smile to his own satisfaction, Mr. Hardesty quailed, while
his heart commenced vibrating against his ribs, as though it would
burst their feeble barrier, and take refuge in his waistcoat-pocket. Miss
Sidebottom, however, showed no such symptoms of alarm, and her courage
rose as Tom&#8217;s fell. By the way, composure in such delicate
epochs is like see-sawing; one ascends as the other descends, until perchance
the weaker party fails to recover his equilibrium, and tumbles
off the fence. Diffident young courtiers should remember this.</p>

<p>Mr. Hardesty was bewildered beyond endurance. How could a man
speak more plainly? And yet he would try once more.</p>

<p>&#8216;Let me tell you, my dear Miss Sidebottom, once for all, I&#8217;m&#8212;&#8212;&#8217;</p>

<p>There was a noise of some one opening the front door, and as Mr.
Hardesty turned his head, Dick entered the room.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why, Dicky, where have you been this cold night?&#8217; asked his aunt.</p>

<p>Dicky replied that he had been snow-balling, of which there were
sufficient marks on his person. His countenance was flushed and heated,
and he proceeded to say that he was tired, and wanted to go to bed.</p>

<p>At this Mr. Hardesty rose deliberately from his seat, saying it was
time to go.</p>

<p>&#8216;But, Mr. Hardesty,&#8217; urged Miss Peggy, &#8216;it&#8217;s cold and snowing; stay
all night there with Dicky,&#8217; pointing to a comfortable bed in one corner.
&#8216;I know you are delicate, and it&#8217;s snowing hard. I&#8217;ll go and see.
Here Dicky,&#8217; and she left the room followed by Dick. Mr. Hardesty
looked around at the comfortable quarters offered him, and determined
to remain. Scarcely had he come to this decision, when the affectionate
aunt and nephew returned, the former telling him not to think of going
out on such a night, and the latter assuring him it was snowing &#8216;like
sixty.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ll stay, Madam, and thank&#8217;ee too,&#8217; said Mr. Hardesty, re-seating
himself. Miss Peggy bade her guest a very good night, and, threatening
to catch him for a Christmas gift next morning, disappeared up the stairs
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page17" name="page17"></a>17</span>and locked the door after her. Tom watched her retreating figure until
she disappeared, and then addressed himself to the boy.</p>

<p>&#8216;Been snow-balling to-night, eh, Dicky? Fine sport, Dicky; fine
sport.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I should say it was, Sir, when your side toes the mark and don&#8217;t run,&#8217;
said Dick, placing his damp shoes on the hearth. &#8216;Them shoes&#8217;ll
never run away with <em>my</em> feet in &#8217;em, certain.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, Dicky,&#8217; continued Mr. Hardesty, stirring the fire, &#8216;you&#8217;re a
brave boy.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes, Sir,&#8217; said Dick, &#8216;braver than you think for. Catch me napping
when there&#8217;s work to do, and I am to get a pie for it in the bargain,
will you?&#8217; The bare suggestion amused Dick, and as he divested
himself of his damp clothes, he laughed heartily.</p>

<p>&#8216;That&#8217;s just what I was saying, Dicky, and was going on to add, that
snow-balling and such like ain&#8217;t for me now, but the time was when
none was better at them than I.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;P&#8217;raps not,&#8217; said Dick, &#8216;but as I&#8217;m rather tired, and don&#8217;t mind the
cold, I&#8217;ll get in and warm the bed, and you can come along when you
like;&#8217; and the light-hearted boy sprang into his nest, and in less than five
minutes was snoring audibly.</p>

<p>Mr. Hardesty stirred the fire, and as the myriad sparks flew up the
chimney, he wished he had just so many dollars; he would give them
all if <em>she</em> would but love him. Growing weary of this delusive sport,
he looked at his watch, compared it with Miss Sidebottom&#8217;s yankee
clock, and finding his own time-piece was just five minutes the faster,
concluded that both were wrong just two minutes and a half, and he
would split the difference. He might be mistaken, but if he was he
would consult the town clock to-morrow.</p>

<p>Mr. Hardesty resumed the poker and stirred the fire until its bright
blaze threw a broad glare over the chamber; and out of the glowing
coals he built strange towers and castles, and saw them change by turns
into ashes, and grow dim like his own recent dreams of love. This being
a melancholy contemplation, he lent his ear to a solitary cricket that
was cheerily singing its household song, though the winds were wild
without. Presently the cricket ceased its chirrup, and Mr. Hardesty
growing tired of sitting, yawned, stretched himself, and walked to the
window.</p>

<p>Outside, the ground was covered with a wild waste of snow, and the
heavy flakes were still falling. Suddenly it occurred to him that somebody
might accidentally pass that way and recognize him; so he let fall
the curtain and walked across the room. Here, lifting his eyes from the
floor, a looking-glass stared him in the face, and he started back.
He turned again and walked to the bed-side where Dick was sleeping.
The boy, he thought, might one day be his nephew, and he revolved in
his mind a thousand schemes for advancing him in the world and making
him a clever fellow.</p>

<p>Mr. Hardesty left the bed-side and looked up at the ceiling. Beyond
that, he thought, was the adored Miss Sidebottom. What a narrow
space sundered them! He walked to the fire-place and looked on the
mantel for a book. He selected an old copy of Burns, and opened at
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page18" name="page18"></a>18</span>the pathetic ballad of &#8216;John Anderson.&#8217; Mr. Hardesty sat down and
read it once aloud. Then he read it to himself over and over again,
until he had gotten it by heart. And then by degrees the room swam
dizzily before him, the fire glowed like a pale meteor, his eyes closed
heavily, the open book fell from his hand, and Mr. Hardesty was asleep.</p>

<p>He slept and dreamed. Smiles like those of sleeping infancy stole
over his venerable features. In one short moment he was the happiest
man alive; his love had been crowned with success; and putting forth
his hand to grasp the dear shadow, he lost his balance and fell from his
chair.</p>

<p>Mr. Hardesty looked around him, wondering. He resumed his seat
and rubbed his eyes. The fire had almost gone out. The wick was long
and dim. He looked at the clock; it wanted just twenty minutes of
midnight.</p>

<p>Mr. Hardesty snuffed the candle and commenced divesting himself
of his apparel; placed his boots beside Dicky&#8217;s shoes on the hearth;
threw his upper garments on the back of a chair, and his nether ditto
on the seat thereof. But his extremities were cold, he thought, and
placing a chair bottom upward on the floor, he put his feet to the fire.</p>

<p>For some minutes Mr. Hardesty stared steadily at the ceiling, beyond
which Miss Sidebottom was sleeping in virgin security; and whether
from the magnetic effect of his constant gaze, or the slumbrous air that
pervaded the room, his eyelids soon closed, and he was again soundly
asleep. The candle burned dimly on; coal after coal was turned to
ashes; at last both went out, and still Mr. Hardesty slept.</p>

<p>Presently there was a stir in the bed occupied by Dick. The boy
rose on his pillow and looked cautiously around him. He called Mr.
Hardesty, but there was no answer. At this Dick put one leg out of
bed, and then the other, and stood firmly on the floor. Gliding
cautiously over the carpet, he stooped over the sleeper, whose deep
breathing assured him that all was safe. Then stepping softly to the
chair on which Mr. Hardesty&#8217;s clothes were lying, he selected that gentleman&#8217;s
nether garment, then went to the hearth and lifted the boots,
and slipping on his own shoes, glided cautiously out of the room with
his booty. Returning in a few minutes he again stooped over the
sleeper, and then stole to bed, where, after laughing immoderately yet
quietly, he was soon as fast asleep as Mr. Hardesty himself.</p>

<p>When Mr. Hardesty awoke he found himself still reclining on the
back of the chair. Not a little vexed with himself for lying there all
night, he rose to his feet, and looking around, found that Dick had risen
before him, and the bed was empty. &#8216;Why didn&#8217;t he wake me, I wonder?&#8217;
said Mr. Hardesty.</p>

<p>Mr. Hardesty walked to the window, lifted the curtain, and looked
out. The mists and clouds had cleared away, and left the sky all bright
and blue. The sun had just risen, and was shedding his early splendor
on the myriad snow-drops as brightly as if to atone for the darkness
and gloom of yesterday. It was a cheerful and beautiful view; but
Mr. Hardesty heard the sound of shuffling footsteps overhead; so he
turned shivering from the window to dress himself for the day. &#8216;It&#8217;ll
never do to be caught in this fix,&#8217; said Mr. Hardesty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page19" name="page19"></a>19</span>His first search was for his boots, but these had been taken out, as he
supposed, to be polished. He would put on his breeches and wait for
his boots. He cast his eye on the pile of clothes, but the breeches were
not there. Then he looked on the floor, and in all the corners of the
room, and then on the bed and under the bed&#8212;but in vain. &#8216;What
the d&#8212;&#8212;l has become of my breeches!&#8217; said Mr. Hardesty.</p>

<p>It occurred to him at length that by some mysterious power of locomotion
the garment had gotten into the drawer of a bureau that stood in
one corner. He pulled at this drawer most lustily, but it was locked,
and Miss Sidebottom had the key. To add to his discomfiture, he again
heard the sound of footsteps overhead. He had but a moment to spare,
and looking around for a place of retreat, his eye fell on a closet-door
that opened beneath the stairs. Putting on hastily the remnant of his
apparel, he presented altogether an appearance the like of which the
writer has never seen, and will not attempt to describe, and managed to
effect his retreat into the closet just as Miss Sidebottom and Belinda
entered the room from above.</p>

<p>Mr. Hardesty applied his eye to the key-hole, but saw nothing save
the form of either lady as it flitted from time to time across the limited
range of his vision. Presently a conversation began between the two,
of which, however, he could hear nothing except a confused murmur,
and occasionally a most uproarious fit of laughter. Before long the
merry tones of the elder lady were changed to those of anger. Miss
Sidebottom was evidently scolding one of the servants, and then came
reiterated sounds of castigation, interspersed with tongue-lashings, by far
the most terrible of the two. Mr. Hardesty resigned himself to his
fate, and was willing to endure a confinement that revealed to him the
evil spirit that reigned within a form of so much loveliness.</p>

<p>After a while came the indescribable sounds of breakfast; the rattling
of knives and forks, and cups and saucers, suggestive to Mr. Hardesty&#8217;s
mind of coffee, hot biscuits, and butter. Presently the table was
cleared away, and he caught a glimpse through his key-hole of the two
ladies, dressed in their cloaks and bonnets. In a moment they departed,
leaving Mr. Hardesty sole proprietor.</p>

<p>Each moment of this time was one of intense agony to Mr. Hardesty.
Exposed to hunger and thirst, and cold and insult, what had he done to
deserve such misfortunes? And that was Christmas, too; what a
merry day to all the world without; and in what a contemptible plight
was he! What would little Master John think of his absence; and
how much would be sold at his little store before night? These reflections
only enhanced the agony of his imprisonment; so wrapping himself
tightly in the folds of his cloak, he crouched down in a corner of the
closet, and soon fell fast asleep.</p>

<p>Mr. Hardesty slept on until night-fall. So soon as he realized his
situation, he determined to be a prisoner no longer, but to emerge from
his confinement, whatever might be the danger of an exposure. Fortunately
for him, the room was deserted. The ladies had not yet returned
from their visit. Mr. Hardesty approached the window and
found it quite dark without. He had little time left for deliberation, for
he heard the sound of a key turning in the street-door lock, and recognized
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page20" name="page20"></a>20</span>the well-known voice of Miss Sidebottom; so hoisting the window,
he crawled rapidly through it, and leaped on the ground.</p>

<p>Mr. Hardesty breathed once more like a freeman; and muttering
deep anathemas against the inhospitable house and all its inmates, he
stole quietly along, with his bootless feet buried at each step in the snow.
Leaving the more frequented streets, and worming his way through bypaths
and dark alleys; now turning a corner, under the direful apprehension
of meeting some acquaintance, and now darting this way or
that to avoid a random snow-ball, he pursued his painful way until he
reached home, where he knocked and was admitted by Master John.</p>

<p>The grocer bolted in, rushed into his counting-room, and throwing off
his cloak, stared wildly at the bewildered boy. &#8216;What do you think of
that, John?&#8217; pointing to his denuded extremities. &#8216;How does that become
your old master, Sir?&#8217;</p>

<p>Master John, frightened partly at the anomalous appearance of the
grocer, and partly at the sternness of his voice and manner, started
back to the remotest corner of the room, but said nothing.</p>

<p>&#8216;What&#8217;s the matter now, you little fool?&#8217; said his master. &#8216;Are
you afraid of old Tom Hardesty? If you are, you needn&#8217;t be; nobody
need be afraid of such an old coward as I am&#8212;darned if they
need!&#8217; And feeling that he was growing melancholy, he determined to
subdue the propensity, and to that end commenced cutting the complicated
figure entitled a pigeon-wing. This exhilarating sport soon restored
the grocer&#8217;s good humor, and he laughed heartily and made such a
racket altogether, that the boy gradually approached him to inquire
what it all meant, how he had spent his Christmas, what had become of
his breeches, and all about it.</p>

<p>&#8216;Here, John,&#8217; said Mr. Hardesty, seating himself by the fire, &#8216;sit
here and I&#8217;ll tell you all about it. But what an old fool I am! Here&#8217;s
twenty-four blessed hours gone, and the d&#8212;&#8212;l a bit or a drop have I had
since last night at supper. Is this my house or not, John? for I&#8217;ve
forgot every thing except one, and wouldn&#8217;t swear I ain&#8217;t dreaming,
and haven&#8217;t been all day.&#8217;</p>

<p>The boy gave him every assurance that he was at home.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, John,&#8217; pursued the master, &#8216;I think the last time I was here&#8212;it
may be a year, or it may be more&#8212;I&#8217;ll be hanged if I know&#8212;but I
rather think there was a lot of prime cheese, and a few barrels of
crackers. You haven&#8217;t sold &#8217;em all, John?&#8217;</p>

<p>John smiled, and answered negatively.</p>

<p>&#8216;I rather think, too, there were several casks of best three-year-old
whiskey, prime lot; any of <em>that</em> left, John?&#8217;</p>

<p>John pointed, in reply, to a row of casks in one corner that answered
the description.</p>

<p>&#8216;No! stop, Sir!&#8217; said Mr. Hardesty, soliloquizing; &#8216;I think she said
Madeira was good for it. Yes, John, I&#8217;ll take a little of the Madeira,
if you&#8217;ve any on hand.&#8217;</p>

<p>John opened a cupboard door, and producing a black quart-bottle,
assured Mr. Hardesty it was nearly full.</p>

<p>&#8216;That&#8217;ll do, Sir,&#8217; said the grocer. &#8216;Set the table; never mind the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page21" name="page21"></a>21</span>cloth. Crackers and cheese and old Madeira, and &#8216;away with melancholy.&#8217;&#8217;</p>

<p>In a few minutes the table was spread according to directions, after
which Mr. Hardesty seated himself near it and did ample justice to the
simple fare.</p>

<p>&#8216;You see, John,&#8217; said the old gentleman, when his appetite was somewhat
assuaged, &#8216;it&#8217;s all on account of that old, ugly, and infernal Peggy
Sidebottom. Here&#8217;s hoping she may&#8212;may never drown her sorrows
in the flowing bowl!&#8217;</p>

<p>The grocer drank this toast with infinite gusto and replenished his glass.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, Sir, as I was about saying, I went there last night to spend an
hour in a little sociable chat, and was about taking leave&#8212;&#8212;&#8217; At this
point the speaker was interrupted by several violent raps at the door.</p>

<p>&#8216;Who&#8217;s that?&#8217; inquired Mr. Hardesty, draining his glass.</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s me,&#8217; said a voice from without.</p>

<p>&#8216;What do you want?&#8217; said Mr. Hardesty.</p>

<p>&#8216;Nothin&#8217;; what do <em>you</em> want?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Who the d&#8212;&#8212;l are you?&#8217; said the grocer, in a voice of thunder.</p>

<p>&#8216;Dick!&#8217; replied the voice.</p>

<p>&#8216;Dick what?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Dick Sidebottom!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What do you want here?&#8217; said the grocer, rising and pacing the
floor. &#8216;John, where&#8217;s my cow-hide? Clear yourself, you little rascal,
or I&#8217;ll&#8212;&#8212;&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But I&#8217;ve got your breeches and your boots, Sir,&#8217; said Dick.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh! you <em>have</em>, have you?&#8217;&#8212;and Mr. Hardesty threw aside the cow-hide,
and opened the door. Dick marched boldly in, deposited his
plunder on a chair, and then looked Mr. Hardesty full in the face with
a glance of perfect innocence. The owner of the recovered booty
picked them up, examined them closely to satisfy himself of their identity,
and without saying a word, put them on in their appropriate places.
This done, he surveyed himself with a smile of approbation, and felt
that he was indeed Mr. Hardesty once more. After helping Dick to a
highly sweetened draught from the contents of the black bottle, he
begged of him a detailed account of the affair of the lost boots and
breeches. This Dick proceeded to give; by telling, in his peculiar and
highly figurative manner, how his aunt had first suggested the feat to
him; how he had risen while Mr. Hardesty was asleep, secured the
booty, and hid it in an adjoining hay-loft; how his aunt had promised
him a Christmas pie, and though often requested thereto, had failed to
comply; how she had inflicted personal chastisement on him for some
trivial offence; and how, on reflecting what a kind-hearted old gentleman
Mr. Hardesty was, and what a crabbed old thing Aunt Peggy was,
he had repented of his theft, and determined to make restitution at the
earliest opportunity; &#8216;and there they are on you,&#8217; said Dick, in conclusion,
&#8216;and that&#8217;s all about it.&#8217;</p>

<p>Mr. Hardesty listened with due attention to this detail, and then sat
for some time in silence.</p>

<p>&#8216;And you can swear to all this in a court of justice, can you?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Certainly, Sir.&#8217;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page22" name="page22"></a>22</span>&#8216;And you&#8217;ll do it when called on?&#8217;</p>

<p>Dick bowed his head in assent.</p>

<p>&#8216;Good!&#8217; said Mr. Hardesty, grasping the boy&#8217;s hand. &#8216;Take a little
more of this,&#8217; he continued, filling Dick&#8217;s glass. &#8216;Your aunt shall suffer
for this yet, if there&#8217;s any law or justice in the land.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ain&#8217;t there no law,&#8217; inquired Dick, pausing in his draught, &#8216;for
suing an old lady for &#8217;sault and batterhim?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No, Dicky, I fear not in your case; but if I get any damages, I&#8217;ll
give you half.&#8217;</p>

<p>Dick drained the contents of his glass, and shaking hands most cordially
with Mr. Hardesty and Master John, bade them good night. It
is scarcely necessary to add, that the last surviving male heir of the
Sidebottoms was gloriously drunk in less than an hour, and made such
a demonstration of that fact to his sober and discreet aunt, that she
caused his head to be soused repeatedly in cold water, and then flogged
him into sobriety.</p>

<p>It is not to be supposed that the disappearance of the village grocer
from his usual post for a whole day together, and particularly on Christmas,
that busiest of all days, failed to excite a degree of general curiosity
and inquisitiveness as to the cause of his absence; but to the
many inquiries of his friends touching that subject, he only replied by
shaking his head and saying that time would show. Enough had leaked
out, however, to satisfy the public that the affair was shrouded in a
mystery that was worth the trouble of penetrating; so that when on the
morning of the first of January immediately succeeding the year that
had just closed, Mr. Thomas Hardesty and Miss Margaret Sidebottom
were summoned each by three lusty cheers from the town-crier to appear
before his worship the police judge of Idleberg, the populace rushed to
the scene of judicial conflict, until the humble and contracted audience-chamber
was crowded to overflowing.</p>

<p>The witnesses summoned in the case were Mrs. Jenkins, Jake Crow,
and Master Dick Sidebottom. In due time the defendant came into
court, leaning on the arm of her next friend and privy counsellor, Mrs.
Jenkins, who as usual was attended by a bevy of young Jenkinses.
Before embarking in this trying embassy, the ladies, by the way, had
gone to the Madeira bottle; the one complaining of a pain in the breast,
and the other of general nervousness. Mr. Hardesty was unattended,
and so were his remaining witnesses.</p>

<p>The warrant gravely charged the defendant with stealing or causing
to be stolen from the plaintiff, on the night of the twenty-fourth of December
last past, a pair of boots and a pair of breeches, whose respective
values were duly set forth. The reading of this document created quite
a sensation throughout the court-room. Mrs. Jenkins was called and
sworn. She deposed that on the night specified in the warrant, she had
taken tea at the defendant&#8217;s house; that she was suddenly called home,
missing thereby a great deal of anticipated pleasure; that the defendant
passed the next day, being Christmas-day, at her (witness&#8217;s)
house; and witness did not at any time see defendant steal or cause to
be stolen from plaintiff the said boots and breeches, nor did she believe
Miss Sidebottom to be capable of such an act; &#8216;and particular,&#8217; she
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page23" name="page23"></a>23</span>said in conclusion, &#8216;from such a pitiful old scamp as Tom Hardesty;&#8217;
and glancing around triumphantly at the audience, and scornfully at
the plaintiff, she waited for the court&#8217;s cross-questions.</p>

<p>&#8216;Is that all you know about the case, Madam?&#8217; inquired his worship,
smiling.</p>

<p>That was all.</p>

<p>&#8216;You can retire. Call Jake Crow.&#8217;</p>

<p>Mr. Crow stood in no need of being called, as he marched up to the
judge immediately, and deposed that on the last Christmas-eve night,
he had called at defendant&#8217;s house for Mrs. Jenkins, as old Jenkins had
been knocked on the head and carried home drunk. (At this Mrs.
Jenkins looked like a carnation pink, and commenced fanning herself
violently with her pocket-handkerchief.) Witness, however, did not
enter the house, and knew nothing whatever of the matter in dispute.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You can retire, Mr. Crow. Call Richard Sidebottom.&#8217;</p>

<p>Dick had managed, with his usual restlessness, to retire some time before
this from the crowded room, and was breathing the pure air and
playing his boyish pranks in a distant part of the town. The officer
who was despatched for the young gentlemen returned presently, lugging
him by the coat-collar. After being introduced to the court by the
usual solemnities, Dick proceeded to give in detail the events of the
memorable night, as already known to the reader. He also gave an interesting
account of the defendant&#8217;s oft-repeated cruelties to himself
personally; how on Christmas night he had restored the stolen articles
to plaintiff, and how the rightful proprietor was wearing the same in
court.</p>

<p>A general hurrah and stamping of feet succeeded the delivery of this
testimony; at which the judge frowned, and the constable cried &#8216;Order!&#8217;
with all his lungs.</p>

<p>&#8216;Mr. Hardesty,&#8217; said the judge, when order was restored, &#8216;do you
feel disposed to prosecute this suit? I fear I must dismiss the warrant,
on the ground that the court can furnish no relief in the case. What
say you?&#8217;</p>

<p>Mr. Hardesty arose. &#8216;May it please your worship, the time was,
and I care not who knows it, when I entertained for the defendant in
this cause feelings of the most profound respect and admiration. And
I had been led to hope that my passion was not altogether disregarded;
that Miss Sidebottom would one day become Mrs. Hardesty. And this,
Sir, as detailed to you by the last witness, her own nephew, is the treatment
I have received!&#8217; The speaker paused and applied his pocket
handkerchief to his eyes. The audience was touched. &#8216;It ain&#8217;t the
temporary loss of my breeches; it ain&#8217;t the long weary hours I spent
shivering in that closet; it ain&#8217;t the wading home bare-footed in the
snow; it ain&#8217;t the finger of scorn some gentlemen may p&#8217;int at me now,
that wounds my heart; but it&#8217;s feeling and knowing that the woman I
loved better than my own life; the woman I would have lived for, or
died for, to make her happy; that that very woman&#8212;&#8212;&#8217; He could say
no more; his feelings overpowered him, and he sat down.</p>

<p>Miss Sidebottom&#8217;s sympathies were evidently touched throughout this
harangue. Until now, she had been rocking to and fro in her seat, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page24" name="page24"></a>24</span>when Mr. Hardesty concluded, she rushed through the crowd, threw herself
on his neck, and kissed him passionately.</p>

<p>&#8216;Clear the room!&#8217; bawled his worship, starting to his feet. &#8216;Clerk,&#8217;
he continued, addressing that official personage, who was standing near,
&#8216;write me a license to unite Thomas Hardesty and Margaret Sidebottom
in the holy bands of matrimony. I know they are of age, and don&#8217;t
need any guardeens.&#8217;</p>

<p>The judge sat down, convulsed by his own wit, while the clerk proceeded
to his task. The loving pair looked up and smiled through their
tears. &#8216;I loved you, Tom, all the time; I did indeed. It was all in
fun, dear man&#8212;indeed it was!&#8217; Tom Hardesty threw his arms around
her neck, and pressed her head to his bosom.</p>

<p>&#8216;Come!&#8217; said his worship, after reading the license, &#8216;none of your
hysterics here, but stand up and be married.&#8217; And married they were;
and the bride, in consideration of her cruelty, paid the costs of the suit
and the marriage fees; and off they marched homeward, amid the
deafening huzzas of the multitude that was gathered in the street.</p>

<p>Happy New-Year! that sealed Tom Hardesty&#8217;s happiness! Many
a changing season has come and gone since then, and nobody knows
but they are the happiest couple in Idleberg. Mr. Hardesty&#8217;s first domestic
advice to his bride was to decline Mrs. Jenkins&#8217;s farther acquaintance,
which she did most readily. The old gentleman has long
since despaired of having an heir direct, but has promised John, who is
prospering behind his old master&#8217;s counter, that he and Belinda shall
marry before long. Mr. Richard Sidebottom is one of the &#8216;reformed
drunkards,&#8217; and eschews Madeira especially. He is now an attorney,
<i>in embryo</i>, and gives ample promise of carrying into his profession all
the acuteness and cunning which distinguished his exploits on the memorable
night that opened this chapter in the biography of Mr. Tom
Hardesty.</p>

<p>With years yet unborn, I have stood in the hall</p>
<p>That was reared by our sire, awaiting his call:</p>
<p>Last eve, as I lay on his bosom at rest,</p>
<p>I saw slowly rise a white cloud in the west;</p>
<p>Now through the blue ether, through regions of space,</p>
<p>It floated up softly, with fairy-like grace,</p>
<p>And paused &#8217;neath the light of the white-shining stars,</p>

<p>A sound in the air, and a wail on the breeze,</p>
<p>Swift as wave follows wave on tempest-tossed seas;</p>
<p>Thin shadows swept by in that funeral train,</p>
<p>As glide o&#8217;er old battle-grounds ghosts of the slain.</p>

<p>How bent was his figure, how furrowed his brow,</p>
<p>How weary he looked from his pilgrimage now!</p>
<p>The phantoms of Passion, of Hope and Despair,</p>

<p>The Months stood around, and the bright dancing Hours</p>

<li>The <span class="special_name">Lord</span> is my shepherd; I shall not want.</li>
<li>He maketh me to lie down in green pastures; He leadeth me beside the still waters; He restoreth my soul.</li>
</ol>
<p class="sign"><span class="author">A Psalm of David.</span></p>
</div>
</div>



<p><span class="first_word">As</span> I walk over the surface of this fair Earth, an erring and a wayward
being, at times dejected by the trials of a solitary and an almost
abortive life, or sustained or elevated by its prosperous incidents; I
sometimes think that no one other blessing of existence hath ever comforted
my heart and restored my soul so much, as the pleasures and delights
of <span class="special_name">Colour</span>. It is my wealth, my joy, my faculty, my fountain!</p>

<p>The recreative pleasure that others find in Music, although this is not
denied is less to me than to them, a restorative and a balm. Music
excites, arouses me; melts me into weakness, or animates me into passionate
exertion; but it is in the green pasture and beside the still
waters, in bowers apparelled with white and red; it is in the tints with
which autumn is bedecked, and Day expires; that I feel I shall not
want, and that <span class="special_name">God</span> restoreth my soul! And it is among huge and solitary
mountain masses of grey castellated rock, in the crevices of which
the stinted pine, and the cedar with its brown and tattered trunk, struggle
out a hard and scanty existence and are yet covered with never-fading
verdure&#8212;mountains to which the Saviour of mankind might
have retired to meditate and pray&#8212;that I feel that the Lord is my
Shepherd, and shall bring me to the green pastures, and lead me beside
the still waters; my Rock! my fortress! and my high tower!</p>

<p>Sometimes my heart takes a fancy altogether for <em>brown</em> hues; and
as you cannot at all times command these in the country, I seat myself
down quietly in front of a precious Cuyp with which <span class="special_name">God</span> hath endowed
me, and that (except the sky and water) is composed entirely of them
in every gradation and shade; and when I rise up from the contemplation
of it, I feel that it is in brown hues that <span class="special_name">God</span> restoreth my soul.</p>

<p>Sometimes I dwell upon the silvery trunk of the birch-tree, or upon
the darker hue of the beech. Sometimes my soul drinks the full beauties
of the umbrageous chestnut; or revels in the golden berries, and
the graceful branches that seem overladen with them, of the mountain-ash.
As I grow old I wave often in the grey pendulous mosses of the
South, or stand in thought under the gigantick branches of the live oak,
with all its leaves of laurel, and its heroick gesture. <span class="special_name">Good God</span>! I say,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page27" name="page27"></a>27</span>when I think that we might all have been born, ate, drank, smoked,
grown up, built, propagated, and died, as thoroughly and effectually
as we now do, and all these precious objects of our sight and joy been
made for us&#8212;out of the one desolate colour of an old pipe!</p>

<p>And <span class="special_name">Water</span>&#8212;that element of Life, that upon the plaintain-leaf looks
so like a molten mass of diamond that you can hardly persuade yourself
it is aught else, might as well have been created of a mere drab quaker-colour;
or not even as bright as a bit of Quartz Rock! and yet have
satisfied our thirst as well as if it had gushed forth from the limpid
sources of the Croton; or been drawn from the transparent body of Lake
George; or from those mountain streams of sparkling chrystal that, in
alternate shade and gleams of light of tropical brilliancy, bound and
gush and dance their way downward from rock to rock to the sound of
their own musick, and make themselves into rivers of joy as they descend
along the <i>Grand Etang</i> of the Island of Grenada!</p>

<p>And <span class="special_name">Wine</span>, that <span class="special_name">God</span> hath sent to make glad the heart of man, and
hath blessed it in the cup; and which might perhaps have had the same
hilarious effect, though it were of the dingy colour of the ashes of the
grate by which I sit; but which, for our more perfect happiness, He
hath made to outvie the Topaz and the Ruby, in its lustre and its
varied hue!</p>

<p>There are many of us who have this one quality, the love of colour,
in common with the magnificent <span class="special_name">David</span>, whose precious inspiration I
have quoted at the head of my Essay, and who in a thousand passages
interweaves it like a golden thread amid his works; but as in the minds
of many others, it may be a blessing only half appreciated, I have
thought that a few words upon this subject might fall not unfruitfully
upon the heart, perchance of some one young Reader of this article, just
opening to the knowledge of this peculiar work of the great Master of
mankind, <span class="special_name">Colour</span>.</p>

<p>Even Music, although itself an occupation revealed to us as of the
Angels of Light, is, except perhaps as they enjoy it&#8212;with whom poetry
and modulated sound adapted to the thought are inseparably one&#8212;even
music is less refined, less gentle, perfect, unobtrusive. For the
enjoyment of Colour involves no possible interruption of another&#8217;s tastes;
no outbreak upon the quiet stillness of the day; no intrusion on &#8216;the
ear of night;&#8217; nor yet any expression, that by pouring abroad the sensations,
might diminish the deep earnestness of the soul; which, all
sight, all ear, becomes the Recipient. The enjoyment of colour is the
Spirit within us listening to the language of <span class="special_name">God</span>! to the mute expression
of His unspeakable Love! <span class="special_name">Colour</span>&#8212;the conception He hath
chosen for His bow of promise in the Heavens! by which He decorates
the Earth, and tells of Himself in the ocean, and in the sky, and by
which He restoreth the Soul of man!</p>

<p>And in that state of celestial existence which attends the redeemed
Soul disenthralled from &#8216;the body of this death,&#8217; is it to be doubted, that
among the joys that &#8216;the eye hath never seen, nor the heart conceived,&#8217;
there exist colours beautiful beyond all earthly wealth of imagination;
beyond the poet&#8217;s fancy and the painter&#8217;s dream? There where the
pure gold of which the city is constructed, is transparent as glass, and
each gate is one pearl, and the very foundations of the walls are of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page28" name="page28"></a>28</span>jasper, and chalcedony, sapphire, emerald, ruby, amethyst and topaz;
and the glory of <span class="special_name">God</span> is the light that lightens it!</p>

<p>But it is not to another world that the joys of colour are postponed,
nor even to another climate that we need look for the precious satisfaction
that they impart. We have not the carpets of flowers of rainbow
tints, that spread themselves over whole prairies of Texas and Mexico,
but what a gem upon the bosom of Earth when it is unexpectedly
found among us is the blue campanula! And the small white lily of the
valley, sheltered and concealed in its green leaves like a hidden tear of
Joy, and almost as rare! And the bright and graceful lobelia cardinalis
that loves the neighbourhood of the still waters. And the fringed gentian
of a tint so cerulean that our true poet derives it from the firmament;
as his own spirit, if left to approach its kindred element, might claim
affinity with the overshadowing expanse of celestial life!<a href="#fn3" class="fnmarker" id="fnm3" title="This allusion is to BRYANTâ€™S lines...">3</a></p>

<p>I speak not to thee of the gorgeous sunsets and of those piles of
massy clouds of living and ever-varying colours on which the Day
pillows himself to rest in a luxurious repose; but open thine heart upon
the Eastern bank of the Hudson at the grey of morning, and look with
the Sun upon the opposite shore; and as the mists arise and are dispelled
from before thee, there shall come change after change of colour
neutral and calm and slowly warming into beauty, until a violet haze
shall rest upon the hill-tops and the cliffs that might outvie the golden
haze of Italy, and that shall raise thy thoughts in silent thankfulness,
and educate thee to enjoy the untold treasuries of colour that glow in
upper Heaven; and hope shall spring forth renewed within thee; and
sorrow shall fade from thy widowed, or thy childless heart; the peace
which passeth understanding shall come over thee; and <span class="special_name">God</span> even
thine own <span class="special_name">God</span> shall bless thee; and to thine eyes, now opened to the
wonders of His goodness, all the ends of the Earth shall <em>shew forth</em> His
praise!</p>

<h2 class="title">THE QUOD CORRESPONDENCE.</h2>
<h3 class="subtitle fancy">Harry Harson.</h3>
<h4 class="chapter_title">CHAPTER NINETEENTH.</h4>
<p><span class="first_word">Notwithstanding</span> his having made what most persons would have
considered a hearty meal at Harry Harson&#8217;s, Mr. Kornicker had nevertheless
such perfect reliance on his own peculiar gastronomic abilities,
that he did not in the least shrink from again testing them. Leaving
Michael Rust&#8217;s presence with an alacrity which bordered upon haste,
he descended into the refectory with somewhat of a jaunty air, humming
a tune, and keeping time to it by an occasional flourish of the fingers.
Having seated himself, his first act was to shut his eyes, thrust his feet
at full length under the table; plunge both hands to the very bottom of
his breeches-pockets, where they grasped spasmodically two cents and
a small key, and laugh silently for more than a minute, occasionally
breaking in upon his merriment to gossip to himself in the most profound
and mysterious manner.</p>

<p>&#8216;A queer dog! a very queer dog! d&#8212;&#8212;d queer, old Michael is!
Well, that&#8217;s <em>his</em> business, not mine.&#8217;</p>

<p>As soon as this idea had fully impressed itself upon him, he sat up,
became grave, and looked about in search of the waiter. In doing so,
he encountered the eyes of a short fat man at a table near him, who at
the first glance seemed to be reading a newspaper, but at the second,
seemed to be reconnoitering him over it. Mr. Kornicker observing this,
not only returned his glance, but added a wink to it by way of interest.
The man thereupon laid down his paper, and nodded.</p>

<p>Mr. Kornicker nodded in reply; and said he hoped he was well, and
that his wife and small children were equally fortunate.</p>

<p>The face of the stranger was a round, jolly face, with two little eyes
that twinkled and glistened between their fat lids, as if they were very
devils for fun; and his whole appearance was cozy and comfortable.
His chin was double; his stomach round and plump, with an air of
respectability; and he occasionally passed his hand over it, as if to say:
&#8216;Ah ha! beat that who can!&#8217; But notwithstanding his merry look, at
this last remark his face grew long; and with a melancholy shake of
his head, he pointed to his hat which hung on a peg above him, and was
swathed in a broad band of crape, terminating in two stiff skirts projecting
from it like a rudder, and giving it the appearance of a corpulent
butterfly in mourning, at roost on the wall.</p>

<p>&#8216;Ah!&#8217; said Mr. Kornicker, looking at the hat, &#8216;that&#8217;s it?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes,&#8217; replied the stranger, with a deep sigh, &#8216;that&#8217;s it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Father?&#8217; inquired Mr. Kornicker, nodding significantly toward the
hat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page31" name="page31"></a>31</span>&#8216;No&#8212;wife,&#8217; replied the other.</p>

<p>&#8216;Dead?&#8217; inquired Mr. Kornicker.</p>

<p>&#8216;Dead as a hammer.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Was it long or short? consumption or fits?&#8217; asked Mr. Kornicker,
drawing up his feet and turning so as to face the stranger, by way of
evincing the interest which he felt in his melancholy situation.</p>

<p>The man shook his head, and was so affected that he was troubled
with a temporary cold in his head; which, having alleviated by the aid
of his handkerchief, he said: &#8216;Poor woman! She undertook to present
me with a fine boy, last week, and it proved too much for her. It exhausted
her animal natur&#8217;, and she decamped on a sudden. She was a
very fine woman&#8212;a very fine woman. I always <em>said</em> she was.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;And the child?&#8217; inquired Kornicker; &#8216;I hope it&#8217;s well.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Quite well, I thank you. It went along with her. They are both
better off; saints in heaven, both of &#8217;em; out of this wale of tears.&#8217;</p>

<p>Mr. Kornicker told him to cheer up. He said that every man had a
crook in his lot. Some men had big crooks, and some men had little
crooks; and although this crook made rather a bad elbow in his lot,
that perhaps all the rest was square and straight, and he could build on
it to advantage, especially if it was twenty-five feet by a hundred,
which was the ordinary width and length of &#8216;lots in general.&#8217;</p>

<p>Having delivered himself of this rather confused allegory, Mr. Kornicker,
by way of farther consolation, drew out his snuff-box, and
stretching out as far as was possible without falling from his chair,
tendered it to the stranger, who in return leaning so far forward as
slightly to raise his person from the chair, gently inserted his fingers in
the box, and helped himself to a pinch, at the same time remarking,
that it &#8216;was a great comfort, in his trying situation, to find friends who
sympathized with his misfortunes. That he <em>had</em> found it so; and that
Mr. Kornicker was a man whose feelings did credit to human natur&#8217;.&#8217;</p>

<p>Kornicker disclaimed being any thing above the ordinary run of men,
or that his feelings were more than every other man possessed, or ought
to possess. But the stranger was vehement in his assertions to the contrary;
so much so, that he rose from his seat, and drawing a chair to
the opposite side of Kornicker&#8217;s table, proposed that they should breakfast
together.</p>

<p>Kornicker shook his head:</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s against the agreement,&#8217; said he; &#8216;it can&#8217;t be done.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But it <em>can</em>, Sir&#8212;it <em>shall</em>, Sir! A man of your sympathies is not to
be met with every day, and must be breakfasted with, whether he will
or not&#8212;agreement or no agreement. Don&#8217;t agreement me!&#8217; said the
stranger, lifting up his chair and setting it down opposite Kornicker,
with great emphasis. &#8216;What&#8217;s the natur&#8217; of this agreement?&#8217;</p>

<p>Mr. Kornicker assumed a very grave and legal expression of countenance,
and without replying, asked:</p>

<p>&#8216;What&#8217;s your name?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ezra Scrake.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I, Edward Kornicker, forbid you, Ezra Scrake, from breakfasting
with me, telling you that it is contrary to a certain agreement, referred
to but not set forth; and I now repeat the request, that you forthwith
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page32" name="page32"></a>32</span>retire to another table, and that I be permitted to take my meal by myself.&#8217;
He threw himself back in his chair, and looked Mr. Scrake full
in the face.</p>

<p>&#8216;And I, Ezra Scrake, say that I <em>won&#8217;t</em> leave this table, and that I
<em>will</em> breakfast with a fellow whose benevolence might warm the witals
of a tiger.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Very well, Sir,&#8217; said Kornicker, relaxing from his former severe
expression; &#8216;I&#8217;ve done my duty. Old Rust can&#8217;t blame me. The
breach of contract is not on my part. I&#8217;m acting under compulsion.
Just recollect that I desired you to leave me, in case it gets me into hot
water, and that you refused; that&#8217;s all. Now old fellow, what&#8217;ll you
take? Only recollect, that each man rides his own pony.&#8217;</p>

<p>The stranger nodded, and said that of course he would &#8216;foot his own
bill.&#8217;</p>

<p>These preliminaries being settled, the boy, who had been standing at
their elbow in a state of ecstatic delight at the proceedings of Mr. Kornicker,
with whom he had become familiar, and whom he regarded as a
gentleman of great legal acumen, and in all other respects as rather a
&#8216;tall boy,&#8217; was desired by the stranger to hand him the bill of fare, and
not to keep him waiting all day. Having been gratified in this respect,
Mr. Scrake commenced at the top and deliberately whispered his way
to the bottom of the list.</p>

<p>&#8216;Beef-steak; shall I say for two?&#8217; asked he, looking up at Kornicker.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes, but always under protest, as to our breakfasting together,&#8217; said
Mr. Kornicker, winking at him. &#8216;Don&#8217;t forget that.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Of course. Now, my son, what trimmings have you got?&#8217; said he
to the boy.</p>

<p>&#8216;&#8217;Taters.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Are they kidneys, blue-noses, or fox?&#8212;and will they bu&#8217;st open
white and mealy?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;They&#8217;m prime,&#8217; replied the boy.</p>

<p>&#8216;Bring one for me; or, stop&#8212;are they extra?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;We throws them in with the steak, gratis.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Then bring a dishful, with coffee, bread, and whatever else adds to
the breakfast, without adding to the bill.&#8217;</p>

<p>The boy, having no other interest in the establishment than that of
securing his own wages and meals, was highly delighted at this considerate
order of Mr. Scrake, and forthwith disappeared to obey it.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile Mr. Scrake, after having deliberately re-perused
the bill of fare, and not observing any thing else which could be got for
nothing, laid it down, and looking at Mr. Kornicker, who was gazing
abstractedly at the table-cloth, said that he hoped he (Mr. Scrake) was
not going to be impertinent; and as Mr. Kornicker made no other reply
than that of looking at him, as if he considered it a matter of some
doubt whether he was or was not, he elucidated the meaning of his
remark, by inquiring who Michael Rust was.</p>

<p>&#8216;The old gentlemen that caters for me,&#8217; replied Kornicker, carelessly.</p>

<p>&#8216;And does he make you eat alone?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;If I dine double, he&#8217;ll stop the prog, that&#8217;s all.&#8217;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page33" name="page33"></a>33</span>&#8216;A sing&#8217;lar bargain&#8212;quite sing&#8217;lar; very sing&#8217;lar, in fact. Does
he keep a tight eye over you?&#8217;</p>

<p>Mr. Kornicker did not exactly know what kind of an eye a tight eye
was, but he replied: &#8216;Sometimes he does, sometimes he don&#8217;t. He&#8217;s
nigh enough to do it. His office is overhead.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Lawyer, I suppose?&#8212;<em>must</em> be,&#8217; said Mr. Scrake, drumming carelessly
on the table.</p>

<p>&#8216;You&#8217;re out, old fellow. I&#8217;m with him, and should know something
of him; and he isn&#8217;t.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ah!&#8217; said the stranger, leaning back and yawning, and then sharpening
his knife on the fork. &#8216;What is he then?&#8217;</p>

<p>Mr. Kornicker raised his finger gently to his nose, winked so violently
at Mr. Scrake that he caused that gentleman to stop short in his performance
to look at him; after which he shut both eyes, and gave vent
to a violent inward convulsion of laughter.</p>

<p>&#8216;What <em>is</em> he?&#8217; repeated Kornicker, in a tone of high surprise; then
sinking his voice, and leaning over the table, he whispered confidentially
in Mr. Scrake&#8217;s ear: &#8216;He&#8217;s hell.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No! he isn&#8217;t though, is he?&#8217; said Mr. Scrake, dropping his knife
and fork, and sinking back in his chair.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes he is,&#8217; repeated Mr. Kornicker; &#8216;and if you was a certain
gentleman that I know, you&#8217;d find it out. <em>He</em> will some day, I rather
think.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Are <em>you</em> that individual?&#8217; inquired Mr. Scrake, with an air of deep
interest.</p>

<p>&#8216;No, I ain&#8217;t, but I suspect some one else is. But come,&#8217; said he,
&#8216;there&#8217;s the breakfast, so let&#8217;s be at it, and drop all other discussion.&#8217;</p>

<p>This remark found an answering echo in the stomach of Mr. Scrake,
who resumed the sharpening of his knife, as the breakfast entered the
room, and did not desist until the steak was on the table, when he immediately
assaulted it.</p>

<p>&#8216;Shall I help you? What part will you take?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Any part,&#8217; replied Kornicker, carelessly.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, it&#8217;s sing&#8217;lar; I never could carve. I&#8217;ll help you as I would
help myself,&#8217; said Mr. Scrake, in his ignorance depositing on Mr. Kornicker&#8217;s
plate an exceedingly tough piece of dry meat, and upon his
own a cut which was remarkably tender and juicy.</p>

<p>&#8216;Do you always help yourself as you have helped me?&#8217; said Mr.
Kornicker, snuffing with great deliberation, and eyeing his portion with
no very contented eye.</p>

<p>&#8216;Always, always.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Then you do yourself d&#8212;&#8212;d great injustice.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ha! ha! good&#8212;very good; sheer ignorance on my part, upon my
soul. But you were telling me about this man, this Rust,&#8217; said Mr.
Scrake, mashing his potatoes, and entombing a lump of butter in the
heart of a small pyramid of them. &#8216;You said he was hell, or the devil,
or something of that sort. What then? Eh?&#8217;</p>

<p>Kornicker, though not at all pleased with the ignorance of his companion,
in the particular branch in which it had just displayed itself,
was not of a sulky disposition, and was easily won into a communicative
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page34" name="page34"></a>34</span>mood, particularly as Mr. Scrake begged him, with tears in
his eyes, to tell him which was the best part of a beef-steak, so that he
might avoid in future the mortification of being guilty of a similar
error.</p>

<p>As the coffee went down, and the beef-steak followed, Mr. Scrake
seemed to relax, and to forget that his hat hung over his head, commemorative
of the recent retirement of Mrs. Scrake from this &#8216;wale of
tears,&#8217; and became quite jocular on the subject of the fair sex, congratulating
Kornicker upon his looks; calling him a lucky dog, and
telling him that if <em>he</em> were him, he&#8217;d &#8216;make up to some charming
young woman with a fortune, and be off with her.&#8217; He then went into a
detail of his own juvenile indiscretions, relating many incidents of his
life; some of which were amusing, some ridiculous, some tragic, some
pathetic, and not a few quite indecent. It was wonderful what a devil
that fat-cheeked, little-eyed, round-stomached fellow had been. Who
could resist the influence of such a man? Not poor Kornicker; it gradually
had its effect upon him, for he in turn grew communicative;
talked freely of Rust, and of every man, woman and child of his acquaintance.
He grew merry over the rare doings which had taken
place in Rust&#8217;s den. He then descanted upon the peculiarities of the
old man; his fierce fits of passion, his cold, shrewd, caustic manners, his
coming in, and his going out; how long he was absent; how profoundly
secret he kept himself, his doings, his whereabouts, and his mode of life.
&#8216;And,&#8217; said he, in conclusion, &#8216;I know nothing of him. He&#8217;s a queer
dog, a wonderfully queer one. It would take a long time to fathom him,
I can tell you. I&#8217;ve been with him for a long time; and am his confidential
adviser, his lawyer, and all that sort of thing; and yet I&#8217;ve
never done but two things for him.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You don&#8217;t say so!&#8217; exclaimed Mr. Scrake, laying down his knife
and fork; and looking at him with his mouth open; &#8216;and pray what
<em>were</em> those things?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I sued one man,&#8217; (being a lawyer you know,) said he, nodding in an
explanatory way at Mr. Scrake, &#8216;and carried a letter to another.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ah! and who were those fortunate individuals?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Poh! I suppose there&#8217;s no secret about it. The man sued, was one
Enoch Grosket. The other was one Henry Harson; a jolly old boy he
<em>was</em> too. I breakfasted with him; a prime fellow; keeps a d&#8212;&#8212;d ugly
cur, though.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Enoch Grosket, Henry Harson!&#8217; said the stranger, musing; &#8216;I&#8217;ve
heard of them, I think. Who are they?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It is more than I can tell,&#8217; replied Kornicker. &#8216;That&#8217;s the mystery
of my situation. I know nothing about any thing I&#8217;m doing, or of him,
or his acquaintances.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Why, you must know what you sued the man for,&#8217; said Mr. Scrake,
earnestly; &#8216;you must know <em>that</em>, surely.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes, but it&#8217;s a height of knowledge which don&#8217;t carry much information
with it,&#8217; replied Mr. Kornicker. &#8216;I sued him on a promissory
note. What he made it for, or how Rust got it, or any thing more about
him, or it, or Harson, or Rust, I know as little as you.&#8217;</p>

<p>The stranger drew himself up, and looking at him gravely, said in a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page35" name="page35"></a>35</span>serious and even stern tone: &#8216;Do you mean to say that you are entirely
ignorant of every thing respecting this Rust; his family, his business,
his acquaintances, his associates, his habits, his plans and operations?&#8217;&#8212;in
short, that you know nothing more than you have mentioned
to me?&#8217;</p>

<p>The other nodded.</p>

<p>&#8216;Waiter, my bill,&#8217; said he in a peremptory tone.</p>

<p>The boy brought him a slip of paper, on which was written the
amount.</p>

<p>He paid it without a word; walked across the room, took down his
hat, put it on his head, and turning to Kornicker, said in a tone of solemn
earnestness: &#8216;Young man, you&#8217;re in a bad way, a <em>very</em> bad way.
Had I known with what people you were in the habit of associating before
I sat down at that table, Ezra Scrake&#8217;s legs and yours would never
have been under the same mahogany. A man in the employ of another
and know nothing of him! It&#8217;s enormous! He might be a murderer,
a thief; a man-slaughterer; a Burker, an arsoner, or any thing
that is bad. Young man, in spite of the injury you&#8217;ve done me, I pity
you; nay, I forgive you.&#8217;</p>

<p>Mr. Kornicker, was merely waiting for an opportunity to suggest to
him that his company had not only been unsought, but actually forced
upon him, and even under his solemn protest. But before he could do
so, Mr. Scrake was in the street; whereupon, on ascertaining that he was
out of the hearing of Mr. Kornicker, he muttered to himself: &#8216;It was
no go. Waited for him two hours; then spent an hour in pumping a
dry well. Enoch Grosket, has sent me on a fool&#8217;s errand. Michael
Rust knows too much to trust that addle-headed fool.&#8217;</p>

<p>Having given vent to these observations, he deliberately buttoned up
his coat, and walked off.</p>

<h4 class="chapter_title">CHAPTER TWENTIETH.</h4>

<p>In a dark room into which even in the day-time the light struggled
in such scanty streams that a kind of twilight was the nearest approach
that it ever made to broad day, but which was now only lighted by a
single candle, that flared and dripped in the currents of air, as they
eddied and whirled about, seeking an escape, sat Tim Craig, and his
comrade Bill Jones, the men with Rust&#8217;s interview with whom the
reader is already acquainted. They were sitting cheek by jowl on two
wooden benches in front of a fire, which they from time to time nourished
with sticks from a heap of wood on the hearth. The fire however
would not burn, but kept smouldering and smoking, now and then springing
up into a fitful blaze, which threw a spectral air over the room,
peopling its dim recesses with all sorts of fantastic forms, and then
expired, leaving it more gloomy than ever. The appearance of the
men, their subdued, whispering voices and startled looks, showed that
at that particular time they were not altogether in a frame of mind to
resist the gloomy influence of the place. The dark, lonely room, with
its large shadowy corners and gaping seams, through which the wind
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page36" name="page36"></a>36</span>sighed and wailed, and the pattering of the rain as it swept heavily
against the side of the house and on the roof, all tended to add to the
melancholy and sombre tone of their feelings. Bill drew his bench to
the fire, looked suspiciously about him, and then, as if half ashamed of
having done so, said:</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s a h-ll of a night! I don&#8217;t know how it is, but I&#8217;m not in trim
to-night. Blow me, if the sight of that old fellow don&#8217;t make one&#8217;s blood
cold. I can&#8217;t get warm; and this bloody fire keeps sputtering and
smoking, as if to spite one.&#8217;</p>

<p>Tim Craig, to whom this remark was addressed, turned and looked
him steadily in the face, without speaking; and then his eyes wandered
about the room, as if he were fearful of being watched or overheard,
in what he was going to say.</p>

<p>&#8216;Bill,&#8217; said he in a low voice, his thin lips quivering; but whether
from anger or any other emotion, was a matter of much doubt; &#8216;d&#8212;&#8212;d
if I know which way to leap! Enoch pulls one way and Rust another.
Either of them could send us to kingdom come. Ugh! how cold it is!
Something comes over me to-night&#8212;I can&#8217;t tell what. I don&#8217;t half
like the job. Bill,&#8217; continued he after a pause, drawing nearer his comrade
and lowering his voice, &#8216;I&#8217;m haunted to-night. You know that
fellow, the man up town, the cartman&#8212;&#8212;&#8217; He hesitated, and leaned
his mouth close to the ear of the other, while in the dim light his face
seemed ghastly; &#8216;the&#8212;the man, last year&#8212;&#8212;&#8217;</p>

<p>Jones looked at him significantly; and then drew his finger across
his throat. &#8216;Do you mean that fellow?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes,&#8217; replied Craig in a husky tone, and scarcely able to articulate,
for the choking in his throat. &#8216;He&#8217;s been <em>here</em> to-night. Three times
I&#8217;ve caught him looking over my shoulder! <span class="special_name">God</span>! There he is again!
Light! light! light!&#8217; shouted he, springing up; &#8216;make the fire burn,
I say&#8212;make it burn! Heap on wood! heap it on! Do <em>anything</em>&#8212;but
keep <span class="special_name">him</span> off!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Why, Tim, you seem to be took bad,&#8217; exclaimed his companion, at
the same time getting on his knees, and setting assiduously to work to
blow the fire. &#8216;Come, this is worse than ever. We&#8217;ve got to work to-night;
and it wont do to go into your fantastics.&#8217;</p>

<p>He paused in his remarks to apply his breath to the fire, and with
such success, that in a few minutes a bright blaze was dancing up the
chimney, lighting the whole room, and dispelling at once that shadowy
appearance which its great size and dilapidated state had tended to give it.</p>

<p>&#8216;There now, that&#8217;s as comfortable a fire as you can want; and arter
all, what you was just talking of was all fancy,&#8217; said he, resuming his
seat. &#8216;Dead men stay where you put &#8217;em.&#8217;</p>

<p>Craig had been pacing furiously up and down the room, as if to out-walk
some demon that <em>would</em> keep at his side; but he stopped short,
and going up to his comrade, placed his hand on his shoulder and said:
&#8216;Bill Jones, that&#8217;s a lie! Whoever says so, lies! Dead men <em>don&#8217;t</em> stay
where you put &#8217;em. I&#8217;ve had that man walking with me for hours
together. I&#8217;ve had him at the same table with me, when I ate; I&#8217;ve
had him in bed with me&#8212;ay, all night long; and to-night he&#8217;s been
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page37" name="page37"></a>37</span>here with his face almost touching mine. Blast him! if I could but
get him by the throat, I&#8217;d throttle him!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Come, come, Tom, none of this,&#8217; said Jones, with more gentleness
than his appearance indicated. &#8216;I&#8217;m sorry for you; you must feel bad
enough, or you wouldn&#8217;t go on so. I&#8217;ve know&#8217;d you since we were
boys together; and I know it&#8217;s not a little matter that works you up,
like you are now. Come, sit down.&#8217; He led him to a seat, and kneeling
at his feet, took his hand in both of his. &#8216;Don&#8217;t give in so, my old
feller. Don&#8217;t you know, when we were boys, how we all looked up to
you; and although I could have doubled you up, with my big limbs,
yet you always had the mastery over me. Ha! ha! Tim, don&#8217;t you
remember the old schoolmaster, too? Hallo! what now?&#8217;</p>

<p>Craig leaned his head upon Jones&#8217; shoulder and sobbed aloud. Don&#8217;t
talk of those days, Bill; it&#8217;ll drive me mad. Oh! if I was a boy
again! But no, no; I&#8217;m a fool,&#8217; exclaimed he, springing up, apparently
swallowing his emotion at one fierce gulp, and in an instant becoming
as hardened as ever. &#8216;Am I crazy, to-night, or <em>what</em> ails me, that I&#8217;ve
become as white-livered as a girl? Where&#8217;s the grog? Give us a sup;
and we&#8217;ll see what&#8217;s to be done.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;There, now you talk right,&#8217; said Jones, putting his hand in his coat-pocket
and drawing out a small bottle, cased in leather; &#8216;that&#8217;ll wake
you up; and now to business. You hav&#8217;n&#8217;t told me what&#8217;s to be did,
and who you&#8217;ll go with, Grosket, or Rust.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Rust,&#8217; said Craig, abruptly; &#8216;he&#8217;s our man. He can bleed; Enoch
can&#8217;t. <em>He</em> never fails in what he wants to do; Enoch <em>does</em>; but they
are both devils incarnate. I&#8217;d rather fight against ten other men than
either of them; but rather against Enoch than Mike Rust.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, what is it? He told you all about it. I couldn&#8217;t hear what
he said.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;He&#8217;s been on the prowl for two days: God knows what he&#8217;s arter;
but he wants us to break in a house and steal a girl.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The profligate willain!&#8217; exclaimed Mr. Jones, with an air of great
horror; &#8216;I&#8217;ll tell his father of him!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s only a child.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh! that alters the case,&#8217; said Mr. Jones, &#8216;Then I&#8217;ll tell his wife.
Well?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;We are to go to the house, get the girl at all hazards, rob the house
if we choose, and bring <em>her</em> here. What he wants of her, who she is,
is more than I know. &#8216;You are to get her, and ask no questions,&#8217; that&#8217;s
what he said.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Who&#8217;s in the house?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Only an old man and a woman.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The man?&#8212;is he used up, or what?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;He&#8217;s a bull-dog,&#8217; was the laconic reply.</p>

<p>&#8216;We&#8217;ll want <em>them</em> then,&#8217; said Jones, pointing to a closet which was
partly open, showing several pairs of pistols on a shelf.</p>

<p>&#8216;I suppose so. Bring &#8217;em out, and look at the locks; not the flintlocks&#8212;it&#8217;s
a wet night; get the others. We must have no trifling.&#8217;</p>

<p>Jones made no other reply than to take out a pair of pistols, which he
carried to the light, and examined their locks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page38" name="page38"></a>38</span>&#8216;Are they loaded?&#8217; inquired Craig.</p>

<p>Jones nodded: &#8216;Two bullets in each! Suppose they twig us?&#8212;are
we to fight or run?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;&#8216;You had better die than fail.&#8217; He said that,&#8217; replied Craig, in a
low tone; &#8216;and when I saw his look I thought so too. D&#8212;n him!
I&#8217;m afraid of him. It&#8217;ll be no baby-work if they discover us.&#8217;</p>

<p>The other robber made no reply, but continued to examine the pistols,
carefully rubbing the barrels, to remove any trace of rust, and working
the hammers backward and forward; after which he put two fresh caps
on the cones. &#8216;All right! I&#8217;m ready as soon as it&#8217;s time. When do
you go?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Not till an hour after midnight. That&#8217;s the time when folks sleep
soundest. You could cut a man&#8217;s throat then without waking him.
Don&#8217;t let the fire get down,&#8217; said he, turning an apprehensive eye toward
the fire-place. &#8216;It&#8217;s cold, and we&#8217;ve three hours to be here
yet.&#8217;</p>

<p>Jones, with the same good-natured alacrity which he had before displayed,
threw several sticks on the fire, and then turning to his comrade,
said:</p>

<p>&#8216;Suppose we rattle the dice till midnight?&#8217;</p>

<p>Craig shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8216;What say you to the paste-board?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No cards for me,&#8217; replied the other, seating himself and leaning his
cheeks between his hands, with his elbows on his knees, and his eyes
fastened on the fire. &#8216;I want to be on the move. God! How I wish it
was time! This cursed room is enough to suffocate one. Curse me,
but it smells of coffins and dead men, and is as cold as a church-vault.
It goes to a fellow&#8217;s very bones.&#8217;</p>

<p>There was something so unusual in the mood of his comrade, that
Jones at last started up and said:</p>

<p>&#8216;Blast me, Tim, but you must stop this. You&#8217;re making me as wild
and frightened as yourself. Talk of your beaks, and courts, and
prisons, and bullets, and pistols, as much as you like; but d&#8212;n it,
leave your dead men, and coffins, and vaults, and all them &#8216;ere to themselves,
will you! Curse me, if you ain&#8217;t enough to make a sneak of
any man. So just stop, will you? If you can&#8217;t talk of something
better, don&#8217;t talk at all.&#8217;</p>

<p>Craig took him at his word; and drawing his bench closer to the fire,
maintained his position, without moving or speaking for more than an
hour.</p>

<p>Jones, in the mean while, for want of employment, again examined the
pistols; drew out the loads, and reloaded them; then going to the closet,
he brought out two very dangerous-looking knives, and after trying the
points on his finger, proceeded to oil them. This over, he betook himself
to whistling, at the same time, keeping time to his music by drumming
his heel heavily on the floor. This, however, could not last forever;
and finally, wrapping a heavy coat around his shoulders, he
stretched himself at full length in front of the fire, and was soon sound
asleep.</p>

<p>Not so his companion. In silence, without stirring, and scarcely
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page39" name="page39"></a>39</span>breathing, yet wide awake, with ears alive to every sound, and distorting
every sigh of the wind into the voice of a human being, he sat with
white lips and a shaking hand until the faint chime of a clock, which
reached him even above the noise of the storm, told him that the hour
was come.</p>

<p>&#8216;Wake up!&#8217; said he, touching Jones with his foot. &#8216;It&#8217;s time to be
off.&#8217;</p>

<p>Jones, with instinctive quickness, obeyed the call by springing to his
feet, apparently as wide awake as if he had not closed his eyes during
the night.</p>

<p>&#8216;All right!&#8217; said he, looking hastily about the room. &#8216;Hey! but
what&#8217;s all this noise?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s a horrible night; all hell seems abroad,&#8217; said Craig. &#8216;But
come; get ready, and let&#8217;s be off.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Will we want any of <em>them</em>?&#8217; asked Jones, pointing to an upper shelf
in the closet, on which was lying a number of uncouth-looking instruments,
the nature of which was best known to themselves.</p>

<p>&#8216;Take the small crow; we may want <em>that</em>, but nothing more.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The bag, too?&#8217; inquired Bill.</p>

<p>&#8216;No; it&#8217;s a girl we&#8217;ve to steal; d&#8212;n it, I wish it wasn&#8217;t!&#8217;</p>

<p>While he was speaking, he had thrust his arms into a shaggy great-coat,
and was tying a thick woollen wrapper over his mouth, so that the
last remark was nearly lost in it. He then put on an oil-skin cap, not
unlike what is called by sailors a &#8216;sou&#8217;-wester,&#8217; and stood watching the
proceedings of his comrade, which were by no means as expeditious as his
own; for that gentleman proceeded very leisurely to encase his feet
in a pair of thick woollen stockings, and a pair of shoes more capable of
resisting the wet than those which he then wore. After this, he put an
oil-cloth jacket over his other one, and surmounted the whole by a coat
similar to that worn by Craig.</p>

<p>&#8216;One would suppose you was a baby, from your tenderness to yourself,&#8217;
said Craig, impatiently. &#8216;You ain&#8217;t sugar, are you? Do you
expect the rain to melt you?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m a sweet fellow, I know that,&#8217; replied the other, carefully buttoning
his coat to the chin. &#8216;I may be sugar for all I know, shouldn&#8217;t
be surprised if I was. I&#8217;ve been told so afore this; let me tell you
<em>that</em>, my old feller. You ain&#8217;t in kidney to-night. Take another pull
at little Job,&#8217; said he, handing him the bottle, &#8216;and we&#8217;ll be off.&#8217;</p>

<p>Whatever Craig&#8217;s contempt of the rain might be, it did not seem to
extend to other liquids; for he took the bottle, and applying it to his
lips, did not remove it until the bottom of it was not a little inclined
toward the ceiling; perhaps its elevation might even have increased,
had not Jones reminded him that it being late at night, the vessel could
not be replenished, and that there was a &#8216;small child&#8217; to be helped after
him, who hated above all things sucking at the neck of a dry bottle.</p>

<p>Craig permitted the bottle to be taken from his hand, and stood with
his eyes fixed on the floor in deep thought; nor did he arouse himself
until Jones took him by the arm, and said:</p>

<p>&#8216;Come on; all&#8217;s ready.&#8217;</p>

<p>Craig started at the words. &#8216;The pistols and the glim?&#8217;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page40" name="page40"></a>40</span>&#8216;I&#8217;ve got &#8217;em.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;And the crow-bar?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;All snug <em>here</em>,&#8217; said Jones, touching the pocket of his great-coat.</p>

<p>&#8216;Good! Follow me.&#8217; Craig strode across the room, and went out.</p>

<p>It was a dreadful night. The rain spouted furiously from the water-conductors,
and sped boiling and foaming through the streets. The
wind too caught it up as it fell, and swept it in long sheets through the
streets; and as the two men battled their way along, it seemed actually
to hiss around them, like the long lash of a whip. The tempest had a
rare frolic that night, and right merrily did it howl over the house-tops,
and through the narrow streets; and fast and furiously did the water
bubble and boil, as it dashed on like mad to the deep river, to take refuge
in her bosom from its tormentor the hurricane.</p>

<p>Not a thing was stirring; not a beast. Not a man, except the two
felons. A right glorious night it was for rapine and midnight murder.
The house-dog had slunk in his straw, and the watchman was dozing
away, under some shed, or stoop, or in some dark door-way. There
was nothing to stand in the way of these enterprising men, save the
fierce storm, and what cared they for that? It was the very night for
them. If it came to blows, or if a life was to be taken, the death-cry
would be lost in the howling of the wind; it was the night of all nights
for <em>them</em>; and so thought Craig and his comrade, as they toiled along,
with their heads bent down to keep the rain out of their faces.</p>

<p>&#8216;Is it far?&#8217; at last inquired Jones; &#8216;we&#8217;ve come a mile.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Half a mile more,&#8217; replied Craig; and that was all that passed between
them, until they stood in front of Harson&#8217;s house.</p>

<p>&#8216;This is it,&#8217; said Craig.</p>

<p>He lifted the latch of the gate opening into the door-yard, and approached
the house.</p>

<p>&#8216;Where are we to begin?&#8217; inquired Jones.</p>

<p>Craig pointed to a small window on a level with, or rather sunk somewhat
below, the surface of the ground, with a kind of area around it.
&#8216;<em>There</em>; there are iron gratings, but they are set in the wood, which is
all rotten. Quick! try them with the crow-bar; they&#8217;ll give.&#8217;</p>

<p>Jones, with an alacrity and adroitness which showed a long experience
in such matters, after feeling his way to the place, and passing his
hand over the bars to discover their exact situation, inserted his crow-bar
between the stone-work and the wood, and at the very first application
forced the whole out. A wooden shutter which opened from within,
being merely secured by a wooden button, gave way before a strong
pressure of his hand, and left the entrance open.</p>

<p>&#8216;Go in quick!&#8212;don&#8217;t keep a fellow in the rain all night,&#8217; said Craig,
in a sharp whisper. &#8216;It&#8217;s only three feet to the floor. Get in, will
you?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Shut up! Cuss ye!&#8217; exclaimed Jones, savagely; &#8216;let me take my
own way.&#8217;</p>

<p>As he spoke, he inserted his feet, and gradually let himself down
until he touched the floor. In a moment Craig was at his side, and
closed the shutter.</p>

<p>&#8216;Now, quick! a light!&#8217; whispered he. In another minute, the dark
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page41" name="page41"></a>41</span>lantern was lighted, and Craig, taking it up and throwing back the
slide, turned it carefully around the place. It was a cellar, filled with
empty barrels and boxes; and seemed to be a sort of receptacle for
rubbish of all descriptions. At one end was a door leading to the upper
part of the house. It was partly open. Without a word, Craig went
to it and ascended the stairs, which were shut off from the kitchen by
another door.</p>

<p>Craig opened this, and crossed the room with a quick yet stealthy step,
but with the air of one perfectly familiar with the precincts. Passing
through the entry, he went into Harson&#8217;s sitting-room; from there into
the outer room, communicating with the street.</p>

<p>&#8216;We&#8217;ll open the street door, Bill,&#8217; said he, &#8216;in case we have to bolt
quick. There,&#8217; said he, as he drew back two bolts, and turned the
key, don&#8217;t forget the road. Leave all the doors open. That&#8217;ll do.
We&#8217;ll get the girl first, and then we&#8217;ll see what&#8217;s to be done. First
door at the head of the stairs. Quiet, quiet; there&#8217;s a dog in the next
room.&#8217;</p>

<p>Stealing up the stairs, they opened the door, and the full light of the
lamp fell in the child&#8217;s room. They could hear her low, regular breathing
as she slept. Craig handed the light to his companion.</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ll take her,&#8217; whispered he. &#8216;Bring the light so that I can see.
There, that will do.&#8217; He bent over her. As he did so, he accidentally
stirred the bed-clothes, and the child opened her eyes; and before he
could prevent it, a single wild cry escaped her as she caught sight of the
wild faces which were bending over her.</p>

<p>&#8216;Christ! how she yelps!&#8217; exclaimed Craig, in a fierce whisper. He
clapped his hand over her mouth. &#8216;By G-d! there goes the dog too!
we must be off. My chicken,&#8217; said he, in a low tone, &#8216;if you understand
plain English, you know what I mean when I say if you whisper
loud enough to wake a cat, you&#8217;ll get a bullet through your head. Hist!
Bill, was that a door creaking? I can&#8217;t hear for the d&#8212;&#8212;d dog!&#8217; Both
stopped and listened.</p>

<p>&#8216;It was only the door below,&#8217; said Jones. &#8216;Quick! quick!&#8217;</p>

<p>Craig caught the child out of bed, wrapped a blanket about her to
stifle her cries, in case she should make any, and moved to the door.</p>

<p>&#8216;Turn the light on the door; I can&#8217;t see. There, that will do. Now
then, it&#8217;s open, and the game&#8217;s ours.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;<em>Not quite</em>!&#8217; said a stern voice; and the next instant Craig received
a blow from a fist which sent him reeling back into the room.</p>

<p>&#8216;Watch! watch! murder! thieves!&#8217; bellowed Harson from without,
while from the din, at least forty pug-dogs seemed to be barking in all
parts of the entry.</p>

<p>&#8216;Shoot him! shoot him down!&#8217; shouted Craig, springing to the door.
&#8216;By G-d! the door&#8217;s shut, and he&#8217;s holding it from the outside!&#8217; exclaimed
he, pulling it with all his force. &#8216;He&#8217;s as strong as a bull.
Quick! shoot through the panel! He must stand behind the knob.
Fire!&#8217;</p>

<p>Instead of obeying him, Bill Jones seized the child. &#8216;Hark ye, old
fellow,&#8217; said he; &#8216;shut up, or I&#8217;ll dash this girl&#8217;s brains out. If I don&#8217;t,
d&#8212;n me!&#8217;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page42" name="page42"></a>42</span>This appeal was heard, and operated upon Harson; but in a different
manner from what they expected, for he relaxed his hold of the door
so suddenly, that Craig fell backward, and bursting into the room, with
a single blow prostrated the burglar, who was bending over the child,
and dashed the light to the ground. His advantage was only momentary;
for in a minute Craig flung himself upon him. But the old
man&#8217;s blood was up. In his young days he had been a powerful
wrestler; and even now the robber found him no easy conquest, for he
said, in a husky tone: &#8216;This won&#8217;t do, Bill. Drop the girl and come
here. This blasted old fool will keep us all night.&#8217;</p>

<p>Instead of obeying him, Jones stole to the head of the stairs and listened.
In an instant he sprang back.</p>

<p>&#8216;We must be off, Tim! Some one is coming. Quick! Let loose
the man.&#8217;</p>

<p>But there were two to that bargain; for Harson had heard the words
as well as the robber, and he held him with a grip like a vice.</p>

<p>&#8216;Let go your hold and we&#8217;ll be off,&#8217; said Craig, in a husky voice.</p>

<p>&#8216;Never! You shall taste what you are so ready to give!&#8217; said Harson,
fiercely.</p>

<p>&#8216;Bill, there&#8217;s no time to lose!&#8217; exclaimed Craig, in a stern tone.
&#8216;Shoot him, and have done with it! There, now; I&#8217;ll hold him.&#8217;</p>

<p>The report of a pistol followed; but as it did so, a deep groan came
from Craig. &#8216;You&#8217;ve done for me, Bill. The old fellow dodged.
Run! run!&#8212;my rope&#8217;s out.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Can&#8217;t I help you, Tim?&#8217; exclaimed Jones.</p>

<p>&#8216;No, no; go! Get off; I&#8217;ll not blow on you.&#8217;</p>

<p>Thus adjured, the robber paused no longer. But escape was now no
easy matter; for at the door he was saluted by a loud voice:</p>

<p>&#8216;Hallo! Harry; is this you?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No, no, a thief! Grab him, Frank!&#8217;</p>

<p>The next instant Jones was in the grip of a powerful man, but he
was a giant himself, and desperate. He flung himself with all his force
upon his adversary, and both went to the floor together; Jones&#8217; hand
on the other&#8217;s throat.</p>

<p>There is something fearful in the grapple of a desperate man, even
when feeble in frame; and in the case of Jones, who knew that every
thing depended on his efforts, and whose fierce spirit was backed by
muscles of iron, the conflict was one of such fury that the very walls
of the old house shook. From step to step, from the landing to the hall,
they fought; tugging and tearing at each other like two dogs, while
Harry Harson in vain hung about them; the darkness and the rapidity
of their motions preventing him from distinguishing friend from foe.</p>

<p>&#8216;By G-d! he&#8217;s an ox for strength,&#8217; at last said Frank; &#8216;if you&#8217;d
do any thing, Harry, go to the door and sing out for the watch. I&#8217;ll
hold him.&#8217;</p>

<p>It might be that in order to utter these words the Doctor relaxed his
grip, or it might be that the knowledge of the increased risk that he
would run gave additional strength to the robber, for he made a single
desperate effort, tore himself from the iron grasp that held him down,
rose to his knee, and striking the Doctor a blow in the face that for a moment
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page43" name="page43"></a>43</span>bewildered him, sprang to his feet, dashed Harson from the door,
bounded across the room between the hall and the street-door, and darted
into the street at full speed.</p>

<p>&#8216;D&#8212;n me, Harry, he&#8217;s off!&#8217; said the Doctor, assuming a sitting
posture on the floor. &#8216;He deserves to escape, for he fought like a devil
for it. D&#8212;n him, he&#8217;s a brave fellow! There&#8217;s no use in chasing
him, I suppose; you and I ain&#8217;t cut out for running. If that last crack
had hit me on the nose, it would have smashed it. Come, let&#8217;s see after
the other fellow; perhaps he&#8217;s playing possum, and may be off. If you
don&#8217;t stop the barking of that d&#8212;&#8212;d dog of yours, I&#8217;ll kill him.&#8217; Groping
their way back to the upper floor, from which they caught sight
of Spite, rapidly retreating as they advanced, they found the house-keeper
standing in the room which they had just left, arrayed in a particularly
large white night-gown and wearing a particularly high cap,
with a particularly fierce white ribbon on the top of it, and bearing in
her hand a dim rush-light.</p>

<p>&#8216;Quick! Martha; more lights, and some brandy!&#8217; said Harson, pushing
past her. &#8216;Thank God! <em>you&#8217;re</em> not hurt, Annie! Come, Doctor,
this poor devil is human,&#8217; said he, pointing to Craig, who lay on the
floor apparently dead. &#8216;Look to him; he breathes. I hear him.&#8217;</p>

<p>It needed no second appeal; for before he had finished, the Doctor
had turned the robber over, opened his vest, and displayed a wound in
his breast. He thrust his finger in it, and then looking up at Harry,
shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8216;He&#8217;s a case; <em>must</em> go!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Poor fellow! God only knows what may have driven him to this.
Help me to put him on the bed.&#8217;</p>

<p>Taking him in their arms, they placed him on the bed; and there
they sat and watched him until the dawn of day. The bright sunshine
came cheerily in at the window; the storm had passed, and the sky
looked clear and blue, as if it had never been unruffled. And at that
hour, and in that room, with the golden sunbeams streaming in, lay Tim
Craig, his head pressed heavily back upon the pillow, bound round
with a cloth dabbled in blood. His face was blackened and bruised,
and his shirt and the bed-clothes stained with blood. His breath was
short and heavy, and at times, gasping; his mouth half open, and his
dull eye fixed with a heavy leaden stare at the ceiling. His race was
nearly run. He seemed utterly unconscious of the presence of any
one, until the door opened, and Harson, who had gone out, came in.</p>

<p>He went to the bed, and leaned over the burglar. As he did so, his
shadow falling across the man&#8217;s face, attracted his attention, and he
turned his heavy eye, and asked, in a husky voice:</p>

<p>&#8216;Will I go? What does he say?&#8217;</p>

<p>Harson shook his head. &#8216;It&#8217;s almost over with you, my poor fellow;
God help you!&#8217;</p>

<p>The man turned his head away and looked at the wall.</p>

<p>&#8216;Do you understand me?&#8217; said Harson, anxiously bending over him.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes, yes,&#8217; replied the man in the same mumbling tone; &#8216;yes, I&#8217;m
come for; my time&#8217;s up. I was a strong man yesterday; and now!
now&#8212;&#8212;! It&#8217;s very strange! very strange!&#8217; He muttered a few inarticulate
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page44" name="page44"></a>44</span>words, and then resumed his old position, looking at the wall,
with no sound escaping him except the low panting of his breath. Suddenly
he said, in a louder tone:</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s all very strange <em>here</em>.&#8217; He pointed to his head. &#8216;Were you
ever at sea? Yes; well, well&#8212;did you ever see a ship toss and swing
to and fro&#8212;to and fro&#8212;to and fro, and yet keep straight on? Well,
my brain reels and swims in that way. There are dim strange things;
men, beasts, birds, and ghosts hovering about it; but I see straight on,
and they are on all sides of the path; yes, I see it straight, straight,
straight and plain. I&#8217;m going on it. They can&#8217;t make me swerve;
but it&#8217;s awful to have such company about me on such a journey.
Come close to me!&#8217;</p>

<p>Harson drew his chair close to the bed and sat down. &#8216;I&#8217;ve sent for
a clergyman,&#8217; said he, in a low tone; &#8216;He&#8217;ll be here presently. You
must endeavor to chase away these thoughts; they are only dreams.&#8217;</p>

<p>Craig&#8217;s thin lips contracted into a smile which was horrible, as
without moving his eyes from their fixed position, he whispered: &#8216;No,
no; he won&#8217;t do it&#8212;he&#8217;ll not do it. No; I won&#8217;t blow on you, Bill.
Ha! how hot that bullet was! Lift me up! <em>He&#8217;s</em> there! Yes, lift
me up, so that I may be above him; up! up! Ha! ha! that&#8217;ll do.
Bill, do you recollect the old school-master? There! Up! up!&#8217;</p>

<p>Harson put his arm under him, and raised him. As he did so, Craig&#8217;s
head fell against his shoulder, dabbling it with blood. The next instant
he stretched himself out at full length, gave a shudder; a long rattling
breath followed; and he fell back on the pillow&#8212;dead.</p>

<h2 class="title">SKETCHES OF EAST-FLORIDA.</h2>
<h3 class="subtitle">NUMBER FOUR.</h3>
<h4 class="chapter_title">ST. AUGUSTINE: THE LAST LOOK.</h4>
<p>Our schooner was &#8216;up&#8217; for Charleston by the first fair wind; but the
captain was fastidious, and the only fair wind was directly aft. A point
or two off would not do, unless it had been blowing for a day or two
and was likely to continue till the captain could land his passengers in
Charleston. Running in on the Georgia coast was always very delightful
to the passengers, but not at all so to Captain S&#8212;&#8212;. We had
taken berths in the schooner about the middle of April, and when the
first week in May had passed by, we began to think it would be difficult
to find the precise article of air which the captain desired. During
this time it seemed to have become coquettish, giving us all kinds of
northerly, all varieties of east, and a preponderance of westerly wind,
finishing off with a sirocco from the south-west, (&#8216;a Boston east wind
boiled,&#8217; and the only unpleasant summer wind on the coast,) after which
it stopped short; the sand and the orange blossoms settled again, and
every thing hung perpendicular. The next morning a puff came up
from the south in a very blustering manner, as though it had an immense
capital to back it, but proved very short-winded. Our little craft
thinking to beat us, shook its sails out right and left, and dashed out of
the harbor, rounding the point in a handsome manner; but before
reaching the bar it slacked away, till &#8216;small by degrees and beautifully
less,&#8217; it came to a dead stand; and the same evening we dashed back
again with a no&#8217;th-east-by-east behind us, to the great delight of promenaders
on the sea-wall and the public in general. Ladies rode
through the streets at a hard-gallop; little niggers crept under balconies;
and an individual who shall be nameless performed a feat with a certain
Di. Vernon of that ilk, which resulted in a bill the next morning of some
odd dollars for extra motion, and a severe lesson upon the moralities of
fast-riding. The mid-day weather at this time was decidedly summerish,
the temperature having the <em>feel</em> of about seventy in our latitude,
but ranging there from eighty to ninety degrees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page46" name="page46"></a>46</span>We were beginning the summer custom of gathering every morning
to meet the &#8216;doctor&#8217; (sea-breeze) on the square, only a short walk below,
which I prolonged on the sea-wall to the little schooner, examined the
labels on the berths, crushed an orange at the corner shop, and lounged
up to the nine-pin alley to close up the &#8216;unfinished business.&#8217; After
bowling, if it was too warm to invent any thing that would not be forgotten
before dinner, the old routine was the order of the day; and
back-gammon or flirtation had it, according as we were nearer the
Florida House or the one &#8216;round the corner.&#8217; The thirty or forty
others who had helped make the winter pleasant, had been gone for
weeks, and our little parties for bathing or riding, or any other trifling
matter which might be better than a cigar on the piazza, had that snug
kind of personality which is so much more pleasant than safe, that I
half-wished the thirty or forty had gone much sooner than they did.</p>

<p>I was sitting on the piazza one morning with a number of un-appropriated
blank hours before me, a little embarrassed whether to tease the
big bear in the yard or lean over and give up to it, with the old dog
who was snapping at flies on the floor, when it struck me as something
very fresh, that as the wind was still two points off, I could make one
more sally into the country. Before the thought had time to cool, my
horse was brought to the door, and looking about for a companion, I
asked Miss H&#8212;&#8212;, who hesitated and declined; but I found one in Lieut.
T&#8212;&#8212;, who was that morning going over to Picolata. The distance is
eighteen miles, through an unbroken pine-barren, (one opening only, at
Fort Searle, twelve miles out,) and an under-growth of palmettos of just
sufficient height for Indians to hide in. For a long time the travel over
all that portion of the territory lying south of a line fifty miles north of
us, was with an escort of fifteen or twenty men, who moved at a slow
rate, a hundred yards apart, so as not to present to the Indians more than
one or two shots at a time from any one point.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the precaution of a strong escort every day, out or
in, on the Picolata road, there had been more downright murdering
there than in any other part of the territory, some having been shot
down almost in sight of Augustine. This was not escort-day, but if it
had been, our horses were not disposed to be six hours in the sun, in
going so short a distance. The little grey steed that I had been using
for some weeks was not by any means a lady&#8217;s article, but he had been
alongside of them in many a ride on the beach, and so learned the trick
of combining the playful and gallant in a very pretty manner. His
ambition was to be always up to the mark, and a head more if his companion
would allow it; but at the least indication of rivalry his head
went down, and nothing less than iron muscles could keep him from his
twelve-mile gait. If not well-matched it was his delight to dash ahead
for a hundred yards, and then stop and look back, or perhaps return,
make a short sweep around his companion, jog on sociably for a little,
and then repeat the manÅ“uvre; and in doing this my arms were only
sufficient to guide him a little in case he attempted the barren, and keep
him clear of the saw-palmetto. T&#8212;&#8212;&#8216;s animal belonged at Picolata.
The quarter-master at the barracks had sent him up to be taken over,
and as we mounted at the Florida House, I could not help smiling as I
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page47" name="page47"></a>47</span>recognized the same fellow that the quarter-master had politely sent me
for a similar purpose some time previous. He was long-bodied and
very long-limbed, and having been brought up in camp, his motion had
all the stiffness of the marching step. His point, any two points being
given, was to make the straight line between them in the shortest possible
time, in an unbroken trot; but there was no danger of his breaking it;
he was not capable of a gallop; his limbs couldn&#8217;t be brought to it.</p>

<p>We passed out of town at an easy pace, talking over the last night&#8217;s
ball; and while crossing the bridge the lieutenant called my attention
to his saddle, a cast-iron frame thinly covered with leather, leaving large
rib-spaces on the back, which he commended as being delightfully cool.
&#8216;But, my dear fellow,&#8217; said I, &#8216;why didn&#8217;t you get a blanket?&#8217; He
replied that after getting accustomed to it, it was much easier than the
padded saddle. &#8216;Do you know,&#8217; said I, &#8216;that that horse is a trotter?&#8217;
&#8216;I&#8217;m used to trotters,&#8217; said he. &#8216;You ease up a little in the stirrups?&#8217;
&#8216;No; contrary to rules.&#8217;</p>

<p>We now entered the barren, and the moment the horses dipped their
hoofs in the sand, the old &#8216;forker,&#8217; seeing the problem to be solved, took
the bit in his teeth and started for Picolata. At the first dash the forker
went ahead. He had laid his course, as they say at sea, and no up-helm
or down-helm had the slightest effect upon him. His mind was
made up; no wavering, no playfulness, no scarishness, no looking to
the right or left. Picolata was the point; &#8216;no two ways&#8217; to Picolata;
he was on the right way, and he was the horse to do it in double-quick
time. The little grey had evidently thought it was too hot for any thing
in his line; but as soon as he noticed any thing like game in his companion,
his head went down as usual; and after a little hard running,
we brushed by the old fellow, made the requisite heading, wheeled,
passing the forker on the larboard quarter, and made the circuit, to his
great satisfaction. &#8216;Here we go!&#8217; said I, as we passed him again;
and this time the grey kept &#8216;head on&#8217; for some miles, till at length I
succeeded in stopping him, and looked back. The forker was coming
in a bee-line, T&#8212;&#8212; bobbing up and down &#8216;with a short uneasy motion,&#8217;
endeavoring to make a seat of his jacket which he had stripped off;
and as he came nearer I noticed that he was trying to look very cool
and comfortable. We waited till they came up, but there was no stopping;
the forker went by without winking or noticing the grey in the
slightest manner.</p>

<p>Easing up on the reins till we came abreast, &#8216;How are you now?&#8217;
said I. &#8216;Oh, this is nothing&#8217; said T&#8212;&#8212;, turning round a very little with
a highly-charged expression of face; &#8216;a little rough; yes, a little&#8212;little
rough; but you observe my seat, Sir&#8212;West Point?&#8217; &#8216;O yes,&#8217; said I;
&#8216;very fine&#8212;and cool, I suspect.&#8217; But there was not much chance of
intelligible conversation. T&#8212;&#8212; kept on talking, but his remarks, meant
for the quarter-master, were so barbarously broken, that I could only
guess occasionally at some exclamations, which for point and emphasis
were highly military. Our rate of travel was not, you observe, from
five to ten, or from eight to twelve miles an hour, but exactly ten. That
was the forker&#8217;s motion, from which there was no deviation. If he was
struck, his heels went up suddenly and very high, but it was no impediment.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page48" name="page48"></a>48</span>He evidently took the blow as a military order for a rear motion;
nothing more, and no occasion for malice. Now, if any body wishes
to know about the face of the country; how bounded, what products, etc.,
between Augustine and Picolata, I am unable to give the slightest information
from any notes taken that morning. My perceptions were all
<em>in medias res</em>; and I only remember seeing a wild turkey that we scared
up, and an alligator that made for the water while we were a quarter
of a mile distant, and splashed in in a great fright some time after we
had passed him.</p>

<p>In little more than an hour we entered the opening at Fort Searle so
suddenly, that I heard the orderly report, as he marched up to the commanding
officer: &#8216;Two gentlemen from Augustine, Sir.&#8217; &#8216;Very well,&#8217;
said the officer; and he turned to receive the lieutenant, but T&#8212;&#8212; was
past all dignities. Stretching himself on a bench he ordered brandy-and-water,
and as that was not quite the thing, added a little cherry
bounce, and finished with old Jamaica, and presently went round a corner
with a tumbler of the latter; but whether for external or internal application,
I am unable to say. Without stopping long enough to get stiff,
we mounted again, and after a few closing flourishes from the little grey
entered the city of Picolata, consisting of one house, and were greeted
with the chattering of ten thousand black-birds all in full chorus. A
boat coming up very opportunely, we took passage in her that night,
and next morning were at Pilatka.</p>

<p>A few miles south of that place, there is a small plantation on the
river that had been deserted and the house burned down by the Indians
during the first winter of the war. Some weeks previous, while at
Pilatka, Colonel &#8212;&#8212; had politely offered me a sergeant and nine men to
visit the place, but shortly after reaching it they complained of the musquitoes
and rode back to the camp, leaving me with the guide and Gen.
W&#8212;&#8212; to finish the survey. I now found a young physician who was
waiting an escort for Tampa Bay, and we went out alone; and after
studying trails for a long time, and taking directions by the compass, we
came in sight of the hammock when some miles distant, and entering
by a winding road that was arched over so as to be almost dark as
night, we emerged, after a quarter of a mile, in a little round spot in
the wilderness, which for quiet beauty was beyond any thing I had ever
before seen. There were some forty acres in the circle, and yet it
looked not unlike a dollar in a tumbler, so high and dense was the
forest. The magnolias, a hundred feet in air, were in full blossom, their
white tops making an unbroken wreath over the area, while the lower
branches of the live-oaks were loaded with the long moss, hanging like
curtains, motionless in the bright light, and not a single bird on the tree-tops
to break the perfect charm of the place. Beautiful, very beautiful!
but how strangely still! A squirrel chattering, or the rat-tat of a woodpecker,
would have been something; but there was not a single voice
out; not so much as the hum of a musquito, though it was the hottest
of summer days.</p>

<p>Why didn&#8217;t the oaks speak, or the magnolias? If they had, shaken
their white heads, and raising their trailing garments, had all burst
out in some grand anthem, I should only have thought it quite in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page49" name="page49"></a>49</span>character; and if personally addressed, it would have seemed entirely
a matter of course. I should have replied civilly, begged pardon for
intruding in so informal a manner, and backed out as soon as possible;
and perhaps the click of a rifle would have produced the same effect.
We rode around the little gem, and found the charred timbers where the
house stood, and a few orange trees that the Indians had left; but the
cool spring was so hid in the high grass, that we were forced back with
parched lips to the flat water at Pilatka, which place we reached in
time for a late dinner; and just as the evening set in I took passage
again for Picolata.</p>

<p>All the boats running on the river were in the government service,
and ours at this time was loaded fore and aft with a company of
dragoons, bound to Black Creek. As we left the dock, another large
boat came out in a pompous manner, and gave us chase; and as the
day had been intensely hot, a large line of clouds rolled over the bluff
at the same time, probably from the gulf <em>en route</em> to the Atlantic, and
moving slowly across the river, gathered their black folds around the
pine-tops, shutting all up, river and forest, every thing but our chimneys,
in utter darkness. And now began a scene which combined little
and great in a manner quite fantastic. Boatmen swearing and yelling
to each other as the boats came near collision, and that infernal
scream sounding off through the pine barrens like some spirit newly
damned; horses prancing and threshing on the bows; men growling at
cards, and over head thunder and lightning leading off the storm in a very
brilliant and point-blank manner; all which was quite rousing and
melo-dramatic. While I was noticing the pilot&#8217;s manner of steering by
flashes, a gentleman came up, whom I recognised as a resident of St.
Augustine; and as he had a horse at Picolata, we agreed to go over
together that night, as the darkness was rather favorable, and the road
being sandy, we could ride rapidly without being heard.</p>

<p>It was late in the evening when we reached Picolata; and with a
good deal of uproar, men shouting, steam puffing, and half a dozen
blacks gesticulating on shore, we each made a fortunate leap to the
dock; and walking up to the camp in a blaze of pitch-pine, we ordered
our horses, and at eleven o&#8217;clock entered the pine woods for St. Augustine.
&#8216;I wouldn&#8217;t go over to-night,&#8217; said the man as he brought up my
horse; &#8216;the rascals have been seen about here within a day or two;
for God&#8217;s sake, Sir, <em>don&#8217;t</em> go over to-night!&#8217; But this only gave a keener
zest to the ride. I had carried with me every where a double-barrelled
gun, but I had found it an awkward companion, and having been all day
in the saddle I concluded to leave it to be sent over, and mean time trust
to my friend&#8217;s pistols.</p>

<p>The rain had ceased, and the wind had gone down, but the night was
still so dark that we could only guess at the road by the strip of light
over head, and now and then a flash, which would light up the avenue
for a long distance ahead, and then leave it still darker than before.
As we entered the barren at an easy trot, I was pleased to notice that
the darkness or the storm had tamed my little grey into a very sober
humor, and his companion also was in a very moralizing way. There
was no starting at the lightning, no attempt at running, but with a noiseless
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page50" name="page50"></a>50</span>tread they stepped daintily in the sand, pointing their ears hither
and yon, and as it seemed to me, affecting a little scarishness, though
what they could hear when the forest was so breathless, it was difficult
to imagine; but every little while they would both leap some fifteen feet
across the road, (which couldn&#8217;t be affectation) shiver a little, and then
pick their way carefully as before. We could see nothing, hear nothing;
but horses are keen snuffers, and they might smell when we
couldn&#8217;t; but what was singular, the vaulting was done from the same
side of the road.</p>

<p>We were still keeping up a little small-talk, when some miles in the
forest, both horses, without any jump or start of any kind, stopped suddenly;
and looking ahead, we saw something moving stealthily toward us.
My companion cocked a pistol and challenged; but we only heard a little
grumbling, and I counted him a dead man; but before we had time to
guess about it, something brushed by, and by a flash of light we saw a
glitter of buttons, and a man on horseback. Whoever or whatever he
was, we saw him but a moment, and he was soon out of hearing.
With a remark or two upon the fool-hardiness of the man, we quickened
our pace, and went on at a dashing rate, abreast and Indian fashion, just
as it happened; now one leading and now the other, according to the
wind of our horses; and in this manner we were passing the most dangerous
part of the road, when there was a sudden whizzing about our
ears, and the report of half a dozen rifles. The little grey reared and
plunged and I landed&#8212;where, I don&#8217;t know; but the next that I remember,
I was standing alone in the pine barren. I had been running for
a long time; how far I couldn&#8217;t tell, being conscious only of dodging
often from one tree to another. On looking about I remarked that the
clouds had opened a little, and that there was nothing to be seen or
heard in any direction. Presently I heard a yell, and looking around,
a strapping Indian, with his rifle drawn to his eye, fired as I faced him,
and the ball parted a lock of my hair in a manner very embarrassing.
I levelled upon the rascal, but missed fire; the rain had wet the powder
in the tube. The fellow took no pains to hide himself, but was very
coolly loading again, and had got his ball ready, when I once more started
off at full speed.</p>

<p>It was a sharp race, and a warm one. After running a mile or more,
there was a small stream to be crossed; and with a few well-balanced
steps on a half-decayed log that lay at the edge of the water, I reached
the opposite bank just as my pursuer stepped on at the other end. Hearing
a strange kind of shock, I turned and saw the big six-footed animal
astride the log, twisting and writhing about in great agony. He
had slipped and fallen in such a manner as to pain him almost beyond
endurance. I stood on the bank and laughed at him; and&#8212;shall I
confess it?&#8212;I tried half a dozen more caps at the fellow, with a most
savage deliberateness; to all which he paid not the slightest attention;
but as his strength came gradually back, I took to my heels again, and
fortunately reached the highway&#8230;.</p>

<p>The last ten miles of our ride that night were passed over in a very
headlong manner: we stopped only once, as we heard the cry of some
hounds on the south side, and then on again, keeping our horses just
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page51" name="page51"></a>51</span>within their speed, till at the worst place on the road, we gave up the
reins and let them go. In less than two hours from Picolata, we snuffed
the salt air again; and reaching the open country, walked our horses
leisurely into St. Augustine.</p>

<p>As we entered the city my companion left me; and as I drew rein on
the square, I noticed that the schooner was still at the dock, and all
about the city was quiet and undisturbed. The storm had gone by, its
skirts hanging on the eastern horizon, and forming a back-ground to the
light of the light-house, while the city and bay were bright in the starlight;
and if stars shine any brighter in the small hours, they were
doing their best then. All looked pleasant and quite at home, even to
the sentry at the corner; and there was nothing, you would say, to
make one sad; but as I turned the corner I drew a breath of such
yawning profundity that the old dog at the Florida House started up
and growled impromptu. That dog had held a stout nigger all night in
the yard, not long before; but fortunately he knew me, and after smelling,
to make sure that all was right, he followed me into an out-house,
when I rolled Bob out of a cradle, and giving a general order in a low
voice for a warm bath in the morning, found my quarters and went
to bed.</p>

<p>At sunrise the next morning I was half awake, grasping at the skirts
of a pleasant dream, when Bob came in, blew about the room for awhile,
and cried out &#8216;Massa, did you order um wom bath?&#8217; &#8216;No; clear out!
Eh? warm bath? Yes; warm bath, to be sure.&#8217; And Bob went out,
and came in directly with two wenches and a warm bath. &#8216;How&#8217;s the
wind Bob?&#8217; &#8216;De wind?&#8217; &#8216;Yes; where&#8217;s the wind&#8217; &#8216;Dun know,
Sah.&#8217; &#8216;Well, go out in the balcony and see where it comes from.&#8217; Bob
shouted through the open window, &#8216;De wind come from de Souf.&#8217;</p>

<p>I made but one spring, and the blacks vanished. Going below, I
found the house in commotion. The schooner was to sail at nine
o&#8217;clock, and the signal would be the report of a two-pounder which the
captain carried on his quarter-deck. At eight o&#8217;clock I had been all
over town from the fort to the powder house; looked in at the church,
where were some fifteen or twenty kneeling, silent and devotional; and
was seated at breakfast, when we heard the captain&#8217;s gun, an hour before
the time. &#8216;My God!&#8217; said I, &#8216;I can&#8217;t go without seeing Mrs. J&#8212;&#8212;
and kind Mrs. G&#8212;&#8212;; and then there&#8217;s the pretty Di. Vernon!&#8217; (I had
bade them good-by a dozen times.) I rushed into the street, and seeing
half-a-dozen ladies not far off, gave them a touch-and-go shake; rushed
up a wrong street, then back again, and finally came out on the square
and saw the little schooner&#8217;s sails bellied out full; passengers waving
their handkerchiefs, and the people all around crying out to me to hurry,
or I should lose my chance. But I <em>didn&#8217;t</em> hurry. The idea of hurry,
after we had waited six weeks! That captain too, had he been asleep
all this time, and just awaked? No; I did not hurry, but walked leisurely
across the square, looking over my shoulder occasionally to see if &#8212;&#8212; was
any where in sight, for she had promised to be at the dock;
and passing over the long wharf in the same stubborn way, I stepped
on board the schooner with a stiffer upper lip than I ever remember to
have had in that climate. The moment that my feet touched the deck,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page52" name="page52"></a>52</span>the ropes slipped and away flew the schooner; but in all this &#8216;heat,
haste and hunger,&#8217; from a half-swallowed breakfast, and consignments
of pacquets and kind wishes that were left behind, the sentiment of my
last look was burnt to a cinder.</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p><span class="first_word">It</span> cannot be that earth was given for our abiding place,</p>

<p>A simple tone can rouse it; a smile, or even a sigh</p>

<p>The hidden spell&#8217;s dark origin that chains our feeble race:</p>
<p>But, oh! may we not fancy, may we not sweetly think,</p>
<p>&#8217;Tis between us and another world a dim mysterious link?</p>

<p>Oh! do they not seem beckoning to a purer, holier shore?</p>
<p>And tell me why the well-loved eyes which here upon us beam</p>

<p>Where the mourners cease from mourning, and in smiles of joy are drest,</p>
<p>Where the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at rest:</p>
<p>Oh! there is gladness in the thought; &#8217;tis deep, deep joy to me</p>

<h2 class="title">THE MAIL ROBBER.</h2>
<h3 class="subtitle">NUMBER SIX.</h3>
<h4 class="chapter_head">LETTER TO THE EDITOR FROM HIS ENGLISH CORRESPONDENT.</h4>
<p><span class="first_word">Sir</span>: My friends abroad complain that my last letter reached them in
small type, most pernicious to English eyes, and half hidden among the
rubbish of your editorial remarks, literary notices, and chit-chat with
your million butterfly correspondents. Unless I am better served in
future, I shall be compelled to transfer my patronage to the post-office,
dangerous as it is, and liable to the occasional interference of American
citizens. I have conferred with an attorney, who tells me that there is
just ground for an action for breach of trust, in the unfaithful performance
of the duty you have undertaken. It remains with yourself to
avert any such consequence, by attending more strictly in future to the
proper conveyance of my correspondence.</p>

<p>During the last week I have received a note from the gentleman who
stole the letters. This I enclose to you; and as I do not know where
to address him, I will simply reply to him, through the Magazine, that
although I have the highest respect for his talents, I would see him
several miles on his way to the devil, before I would comply with his
polite request.</p>

<p class="closing">Truly yours, etc.,</p>

<p class="sign"><span class="author">&#8212;&#8212; &#8212;&#8212;.</span></p>

<h4 class="chapter_head">THE MAIL ROBBER&#8217;S NOTE.</h4>

<p><span class="first_word">My Dear Friend</span>: You will be surprised that I have found out your
address, and indeed it required some sagacity. But now that I have,
you will pardon me for broaching a matter in which we are mutually
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page54" name="page54"></a>54</span>concerned. You must be aware how horribly I have been used by the
Editor of the <span class="special_name">Knickerbocker</span>, and all through the share I have unfortunately
had in your troublesome correspondence. He still persists in
refusing to pay me a proper remuneration for my services, for which
hitherto, I am sorry to say, I have received only insult and vexation.
I have been advised by my lawyer to institute a suit at law against the
miscreant, and matters are now in progress toward that desirable result.</p>

<p>In the mean time I have thought proper to apply to your sense of
justice for a partial compensation of the trouble you have caused me.
My character has been assailed, my tranquillity disturbed, and my
valuable time taken up, without a penny of remuneration. Now, Sir,
if you think fit to transmit to the address of &#8216;M. R.,&#8217; through the post-office,
a hundred dollars ($100), I will overlook what is past, and resign
solely to yourself what interest I possess in your epistolary intercourse
through the pages of that infamous Magazine. With sentiments of
esteem,</p>

<p class="closing">Yours, as before,</p>

<p class="sign"><span class="author">M. R.</span></p>

<p class="post_break">&#8216;<span class="first_word">So</span> shaken as we are, so wan with care,&#8217; we begin to wish that we
had never undertaken the publication of these letters. Between two
impending law-suits how shall we muster courage to keep on the even
tenor of our way? Even our staunch friend, the anonymous Public,
torments us with frequent accusatory epistles, charging us with dulness,
impiety, and irreverence for American institutions. All these we must
lay on the back of our Englishman, whose compatriots we confess are
apt to assume a latitude of style hardly tolerated among us. In the
mean time, gentle Public, respected Cockney, and worthy Mail-Robber,
we cry you mercy all round!</p>

<h2 class="title">LETTER FROM JAMES JESSAMINE.</h2>
<h3 class="subtitle">TO THE EDITOR OF THE KNICKERBOCKER.</h3>
<p><span class="first_word">Sir</span>: It has not been until after much reflection on my own part, and
I must say, very civil encouragement on that of my friend <span class="special_name">Mr. John
Waters</span>, whose acquaintance I have chanced upon some months
back, that I have determined to venture, either in the form of an advÃ©rtisement
extra, or possibly by your very polite admission of this self-introductory
letter into your fashionable pages, to submit to the view of
the more refined and intellectual part of the society of the Atlantic
cities and particularly to that of New York, the peculiar claim that I
conceive myself to possess upon their consideration and regard.</p>

<p>I have been hitherto deterred from taking this decisive step, as well
by the very disturbed and almost turbulent state, which, since my arrival
in this country, appears to have characterized its monetary concerns&#8212;alas!
my dear Sir, those horrid yet necessary evils and grievances
of life!&#8212;as by some expectations I had cause to entertain soon
after I set foot upon your hospitable shores, of the immediate death of a
maiden aunt in Cornwall, upon which incident, and her continued celibacy,
depend very much all my present reversionary hopes.</p>

<p>The health of the old lady being however at my latest intelligence
unexpectedly reinstated; the cotton crops coming forward as I understand
to good markets, and the wonderful discovery having been made
of converting western pork into sallad oil; the Tories being put down,
and the banks having entered into what some time ago seemed the <i>paulo
post futurum</i> of specie payments; I desire to share in the general tide
of prosperity; I launch myself upon it at its flood, discard all reserve,
and shall descend at once without farther preface into the midst of what
I have to say.</p>

<p>I came out then some time ago <em>ostensibly</em> to kill a trout or two in
some of your delicious streams; and indeed I may without presumption
say en passant that few professors of the Rod excel me either in
the niceties of my throw, the cool self-possession with which I take my
fish, or the indomitable perseverance and perfect tact with which I drown
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page59" name="page59"></a>59</span>and then land him with a single hair. I say <em>ostensibly</em>, for I have now
no desire to conceal from you the ulterior objects that I had in view of
either making a book to replenish my purse, or of establishing myself
for life in this your rising land of freedom and big crops.</p>

<p>I have had &#8216;good luck to your fishing&#8217; sung to me more than once by
most sweet voices, and have realized it to my heart&#8217;s content in the way
of trout; but this is all. Since I arrived in America there have been
no less than three travelling historians upon the ground, with whose
energy of conception, art of fabrication, facility of combination, capacity
of bitterness and established name, I could not enter the lists.
And as for matrimonial projects, foreigners seem to me to have no longer
any hope of success in consequence of the entire pre-occupation of this
walk of life by a regularly drilled and educated corps of young Americans,
bred up avowedly with no other pursuit; who talk, think, dream
of nothing else than fortune by marriage; and with a shrewdness and
intelligence of calculation that entirely distance the foreigner, (but which
seem wonderfully after the nuptials to forsake them <em>in stocks of another
description</em>,) know at a glance the value, expectations, hopes, and dependencies
of each young marriageable lady even before she comes out; so
that instead of being able to accomplish a purpose of this kind, I find it
quite as much as I can do to avoid falling in love beyond repeal with
the refinement, gentleness, grace, and untold sweetness that distinguish
the portionless beauties of New-York.</p>

<p>Indeed this class to which I have adverted of licensed fortune-hunters
is so numerous; the fortunes themselves except to the initiated are so
uncertain; and the entire want of that most useful profession, <i>les courtiers
de mariage</i>, is so grievous to all incidental visitors, that I have often
thought how admirable the arrangement would be, if the young ladies
were at once to adopt as a fashionable decoration some tasteful head
ornament, on which should be inscribed, in distinct but graceful characters,
some one of such legends as the following, which should indicate
the incontestible possessions of the wearer:</p>

<ul>
    <li>$30,000 State of New-York Fives.</li>
    <li>My face is my fortune.</li>
    <li>$200,000 Indiana State Bonds.</li>
    <li>2 lots on Broadway, 4 in the Bowery and 1 on Union-Square.</li>
    <li>Nothing but truth, discretion, intelligence and grace.</li>
    <li>$60,000 Alabama Sterling Bonds.</li>
    <li>The Tongues, and what you see.</li>
    <li>$27,000 on indefeasible Bond and Mortgage.</li>
    <li>A House and Shop in <i>Maiden-Lane</i> with fixtures, and a careful tenant at 1400 a year on lease three years unexpired.</li>
    <li>Musick&#8212;four pianos done up since this time last year.</li>
    <li>30,000 Pine trees and three saw-mills in Saint Lawrence county: N.&nbsp;B., well situated!</li>
    <li>A large Manufacturing Establishment with unbounded Water-privileges, in Ulster.</li>
    <li>Life and Trust&#8212;40 shares daily recovering.</li>
</ul>

<p>The young gentlemen might wear appended to the third button-hole
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page60" name="page60"></a>60</span>of the left breast, epigrammatical notices of &#8216;<span class="small_all_caps">THE EXPECTATIONS</span>&#8217; in
which they so generally abound, as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Uncle Asa has the phthisick, I am his heir.</li>
<li>As I <span class="small_all_caps">STAND</span>, less my tailor&#8217;s bill of $1800.</li>
<li>Plenty of <span class="special_name">Lots</span>, covered partly with water, partly with parchment.</li>
<li>In full and successful business, owing only four times our capital, due us five times, chiefly in Mississippi. Expect to retire in two years and enjoy life.</li>
<li>Two-and-six-pence in my pocket, with great but indefinable hopes.</li>
<li>A <em>promising</em> young member of the Bar. Three suits;&#8212;&#9758;<!--a hand pointing right--> one of them in court. Grant me my fourth!</li>
</ul>

<p>A young lady, whose nice tact and discriminating judgment are only
rivalled by her sweetness of disposition and exquisite personal attractions,
has divided the world of beaux into three generick classes:</p>

<ol>
<li>The Rich who are afraid of us;</li>
<li>The Poor whom we are afraid of;</li>
<li>The Detrimentalists.</li>
</ol>

<p>The plan I propose would aid manifestly in the due classification of
all assistants at a ball. It is not to be thought that the sex is governed
by any mercenary motive; but in the present organization of society a
certain degree of attention to the mode in which matrimonial establishments
are to be sustained is absolutely imperative.</p>

<p>Conceive then Mr. Editor how this explicit course would remove the
ordinary impediments on both sides. One single <i>tour de Valse</i> and the
whole affair might be adjusted! The gentleman forsakes the lady&#8217;s
eyes and fixes his own upon her tiara; she hers upon his eloquent button-hole.
During the slow movement they have deciphered the mottoes,
have ascertained, (no small desideratum in a crowded ball-room!) each
the exact value of his or her partner; they have arrived in thought, as
far as mere expediency goes, each at a decision; and are ready for
question and answer at the close of the accelerated step.</p>

<p>By the way, as the waltz is now conducted, the employment of the
eyes during the slow sentimental movement seems frequently to the lady
a matter of some degree of embarrassment; and the method I propose
would effectually remove any thing of the sort. There could be no
want of an object on which to rest them; no looking with a fixed gaze
over the partner&#8217;s shoulder; no consulting of the cornice; no care-fraught
expression; no reluctant or displeased look, as if the lady would
have fain declined; no indeterminate thoughts, no indefinite sensations;
no languishment; and above all never more the portentous, the ominous
look which often in that entrancing dance exhibits to us the mysticism
of the Sybil, without one ray of her inspiration.</p>

<p>No; then would the lady look, read, decide, and dance the while.
&#8216;This might do!&#8217;&#8212;then would she sparkle. &#8216;Ah this would never
do!&#8217;&#8212;then would she become placid, tranquil, and complete her tour
with contentment; for as I think some one else has before me wisely
observed, <em>the end of doubt is the beginning of repose</em>. Then would the
faces of the ladies generally become vastly more attractive than at
present during the enjoyment of the waltz; for singular as may seem
the remark, although I have assisted at several New-York balls, I have
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page61" name="page61"></a>61</span>met two countenances only throughout the whole galaxy of beauty that,
in dancing the Waltz, have indicated either joy or undisturbed gratification:
the one, is that of a little sylph-like beam of pleasure, who
might well carry upon her beautiful hair, &#8216;unincumbered lots,&#8217; as her
wedding-portion; who gains our hearts while she laughs at us; and
who, because I chance to be within half a score of her father&#8217;s years,
threatens to call me her <i>vieux chÃ©ri</i>&#8212;while the name of the other, if I
dared write it, would recall the most tasteful and fashionable costumes
of France, with the sweetest poetry of Scotland.</p>

<p>But alas my master! I have gone prattling on without saying a
word of my own pretensions until my letter has gained such a length
that I am forced to defer them to another number, while I subscribe
myself, dear Mr. Editor of the <span class="special_name">Knickerbocker</span>,</p>

<h2 class="title">GANGUERNET: OR, &#8216;A CAPITAL JOKE.&#8217;</h2>
<h3 class="byline">TRANSLATED FROM THE FRENCH BY JOHN HUNTER.</h3>
<p><span class="first_word">Mine</span> is called Ganguernet: I say mine, for you have all had yours;
every one, at least once in his life-time, has met with one of those little
fat, ruddy, burly men, with straight close-cropped hair, low forehead,
grey eyes, broad nose, puffed-up cheeks, the neck between the shoulders,
the shoulders in the stomach, the stomach upon the legs; a sort of a
Punch figure, rolling, bawling, laughing, hallooing; one of those fellows
who come stealthily behind you, clap their hands on your head,
and cry out suddenly: &#8216;Who&#8217;s this?&#8217; Who pull away your chair at
the moment you are going to sit down; who snatch from you your
handkerchief just when you wish to use it; and who, on these occasions,
when you look at them with an angry air, answer you with a
broad grin, and a stare of imperturbable assurance: &#8216;<em>A capital joke!</em>&#8217;</p>

<p>You have had yours; and mine is named Ganguernet. My first
acquaintance with him was at Rheims. He was a complete adept in
his profession, and as a regular joke-player, master of all the tricks of
his trade. Well skilled was he in the art of attaching a piece of meat
to the bell-rope of a porter&#8217;s lodge, so that all the wandering dogs about
town would snap at the tempting bait, and awaken the mystified domestics
ten times a night. Very expert was he also at cutting tradesmen&#8217;s
signs in two pieces, and substituting one for another. On one occasion
he took the sign of a hair-dresser, cut it in two, and added the latter
part to that of one of my neighbours; so that it read as follows: <em>Monsieur
Roblot lets out carriages and false toupÃ©es, after the Paris fashion</em>.</p>

<p>But if M. Ganguernet was not the most agreeable companion in the
city, still less so was he in the country, where indeed his presence, to
me at least, was always a perfect nuisance. He knew how to scatter
the hair, adroitly clipped from a brush, between the sheets of a friend,
so that the victim, before he had been a quarter of an hour in bed, would
become furious with the itching. He would pierce the partition between
two sleeping apartments, so as to pass through it a piece of twine
which he had cunningly fastened to your bed-clothes, and then, when
he found that you were asleep, he would gently pull the string, until the
covering was all drawn down to your feet. You awake half-frozen, for
Ganguernet always chooses a cold damp night for this trick, draw up
the covering, wrap yourself carefully up, and very innocently resume
your slumbers; then Ganguernet, gently pulling his cord, again strips
you naked; again you are benumbed with cold; and when you begin
to utter imprecations in the dark, his detestable voice is heard bawling
through the hole: &#8216;What a capital joke!&#8217;</p>

<p>Did Ganguernet chance to fall in with one of those simple-minded
individuals, whose countenances invite mystification, he would steal from
him during his sleep his coat and pantaloons, whose dimensions with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page63" name="page63"></a>63</span>needle and thread he would contrive greatly to diminish. He would
then awaken his victim, begging him to dress himself as soon as possible,
and join a hunting-party. The unsuspecting subject of the joke,
thus suddenly roused, would try to put on his pantaloons, but could not
get into them. &#8216;Good Heavens!&#8217; exclaims Ganguernet, with affected
astonishment; &#8216;why, what is the matter, my dear Sir?&#8212;you are terribly
swollen!&#8217; &#8216;Am I?&#8217; &#8216;You are indeed, prodigiously!&#8217; &#8216;Do you really
mean it?&#8217; &#8216;I may be mistaken, but come dress yourself, and let us go
down, and see what the others say.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But I cannot get on my clothes.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ah! that&#8217;s it, you are so puffed up. It must be a thundering attack
of the dropsy!&#8217;</p>

<p>And this would continue, the poor fellow, pale and trembling, in vain
endeavoring to get on his clothes, until the tormentor, with a hideous
chuckle, would come out with his famous sentence: &#8216;Ha! ha! a capital
joke!&#8217;</p>

<p>There was one of his tricks which appeared to me to be truly abominable.
He played it upon a person reputed to be a brave man, but
who was nevertheless horribly frightened. One night, after getting
snugly into bed, this gentleman felt something cold and slimy along
side of him, he touched it with his foot; it seemed a round elongated
body; he placed his hand upon it; it was a serpent coiled upon itself!
In an ecstacy of terror, he leaped from the bed with a cry of disgust and
horror, when Ganguernet made his appearance, shaking his fat sides
and roaring out: &#8216;What a capital joke!&#8217; It was an eel-skin filled
with water, that had caused the panic. The enraged gentleman would
have broken the head of the joker, but Ganguernet throwing a pitcher
of water over the sans-culotte sufferer, made his escape, yelling out at
the top of his voice: &#8216;A capital joke!&#8212;a capital joke!&#8217; The master
of the house and his guests came running in at the outcry, and with
much difficulty succeeded in pacifying the mystified individual; assuring
him that Ganguernet, though fond of fun, was in the main a
charming good fellow, a pleasant boon companion, and one without
whom, especially in the country, it was impossible to drive away ennui.</p>

<p>Our readers may perhaps think with us, that, on the contrary, this
man was one of those insufferable beings who are constantly intruding
upon the pleasures and comforts of others; like a dog in a game of nine-pins,
overturning with his paws all the arrangements of your joys and
sorrows; more insupportable, and more difficult to get rid of than the
dog, they lie in ambush to pounce upon you, and disconcert by a word
or a trick the feelings you may enjoy, or the projects you intend.</p>

<p>Among characters of this description, there are some whom their
common-place attempts at wit consign to contempt. These performers
confine themselves to vulgar and stale jokes. To thrust the head through
the paper window-pane of a cobbler, and ask him the address of a minister
of finances, or an archbishop; to stretch a cord across a staircase,
so as to cause those who descend to take, in the words of a punster, a
<em>voyage sur la rein</em>, or &#8216;a voyage upon the Rhine;&#8217; to wake up a notary
in the middle of the night, and send him in great haste to draw up a
will for a client, whom he finds in good health; these and a thousand
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page64" name="page64"></a>64</span>other silly pranks of the same nature, are the stock in trade of a jester;
and no one knew them better than did Ganguernet.</p>

<p>He had, moreover, invented some original tricks, which had given
him a colossal reputation among the admirers of this branch of the fine
arts. The only truly witty one I ever knew him to perpetrate, took
place at a country-house where a large party of us were assembled.
Among the guests, Ganguernet had singled out a lady of some thirty
years, rather fantastic in her manners and appearance, who was doatingly
fond of Parisian elegance, and who preferred the pale face of a
well-looking youth of rather shallow intellect, to the coarse, purple visage
of Ganguernet. Our humourist endeavored in vain to render this
youth ridiculous in the eyes of the lady, who regarded his simplicity as
a poetical absence of mind, and his credulity as an indication of sincerity
and honest good faith. One evening, after a brisk defence of the
pale-faced youth on the part of the lady, which was listened to by Ganguernet
with a patience and a peculiar expression of the eye which
boded no good, we had all retired to our apartments. In about half
an hour, the house resounded with loud outcries of &#8216;fire! fire!&#8217; which
seemed to proceed from the hall upon the ground-floor. Every one
hastened thither, men and women half-dressed, or half-undressed, which
ever you please. They entered pell-mell, candlestick in hand, and
there found Ganguernet stretched upon a sofa. To the reiterated questions
that were put him as to the cause of the clamor, he answered not
a word; but taking the pale-faced young man by the hand in a very
solemn manner, and leading him up to the fine lady, gravely said to
her: &#8216;I have the honor, Madam, of presenting to you the most poetic
genius of the company in a cotton night-cap.&#8217; We all burst into a shout
of laughter, but the lady never forgave Ganguernet, nor the cotton
night-cap.</p>

<p>All the jokes which Ganguernet played, however, were not prompted
by vengeance; a spirit of fun merely being the grand principle of most
of his tricks. Before we come to the occurrence which showed this
man to me in his true colors, I must relate a few more of the humorous
pranks in which he took the greatest pride. Opposite his residence at
Rennes there dwelt a worthy pair of venerable citizens, who were the
sole occupants of a small house, which was their only possession.
Once a week this honest couple were in the habit of dining, and having
a little game of piquet with a relation, who resided at some distance
from their abode. On these occasions they were usually regaled with
curds and whey, which they moistened with sparkling cider; and not
unfrequently a bowl of punch concluded the repast; so that the worthy
pair commonly returned home about eleven o&#8217;clock, singing and staggering
along in a state of happy elevation.</p>

<p>On a certain fatal Sunday evening, these good folks returned to their
abode, both of them pretty much, &#8216;how came you so.&#8217; They arrived
at the door of their next neighbour, which they recognized, and then
proceeded on ten paces farther, which was just the distance to their own
door. The husband, after fumbling in his pocket for the key of the
street-door, pulled it out, and sought the key-hole; but no key-hole was
to be found. &#8216;What has become of the key-hole?&#8217; cried he. &#8216;You
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page65" name="page65"></a>65</span>have drank too much cider, Monsieur Larquet,&#8217; said his wife; &#8216;you
are looking for the key-hole, and we are still before the wall of neighbour
Bompart.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;That is true,&#8217; replied Monsieur Larquet; &#8216;we must go a few paces
farther.&#8217; They walked on; but this time they went too far, for as they
had before recognized the door of their right-hand neighbor, they now
found themselves in front of that of their neighbor on the left hand.
Their own door ought to be between these two doors. They return,
groping along the wall until they come to a door, which to their consternation
they again find to be that of their right-hand neighbor! The
honest couple become alarmed about the soundness of their wits, and
begin to suspect that they must certainly both be tipsy. They recommence
their inspections from the door of their neighbor on the right,
and again come to the door of their neighbor on the left. They constantly
find these two doors, but not a vestige of their own: their door
has disappeared&#8212;vanished! Who could have taken away their door?
Terror seizes them; they ask each other if they have become demented;
and dreading the ridicule which would be cast upon honest citizens
who could not find their own street-door, they grope about for more than
an hour, feeling, poking, inspecting, measuring; but alas! there is no
door; there is nothing but a wall, an unknown wall, an implacable
wall, a desperate wall! At length, terror completely overpowers them;
they utter loud cries, and call lustily for assistance. The neighbors
are attracted by the noise, and after some time, it is ascertained that
the door of the distracted couple has been carefully bricked up, and
plastered over; and when all are trying to discover who could have
played such a pitiful trick upon these honest people, Ganguernet,
who from an opposite window, in company with some kindred spirits,
had been enjoying the tribulation and despair of Monsieur and Madame
Larquet, Ganguernet shouts out his everlasting refrain: &#8216;A capital
joke!&#8217; But, answered the neighbors, these poor folks will take their
death of cold.</p>

<p>&#8216;Bah!&#8217; replies he; &#8216;a capital joke!&#8217;</p>

<p>The incensed neighbors petitioned the king&#8217;s attorney to moderate
Monsieur Ganguernet&#8217;s strong inclination to play his mischievous
pranks; and the magistrate sent our hero to prison for some days, in
spite of his skilful defence, which consisted in incessantly repeating:
&#8216;A capital joke!&#8212;what a capital joke, Mr. Magistrate!&#8217;</p>

<p>Notwithstanding his excessive vanity, Ganguernet did not, however,
make boast of all his exploits; and there was one, the authorship of
which he constantly denied, possibly in consequence of a threat that
was held out of cutting off the author&#8217;s ears, should he be detected.
The trick in question was prompted by the contempt in which he was
held in a certain aristocratic circle; and the subject was no less a personage
than an ancient dame of high birth, and great pretensions, who
mingled in the most fashionable society of Rennes.</p>

<p>Among other customs of the old school, which this lady retained,
were the following: First, that of never mixing in the society of those
of plebeian descent, such as Ganguernet: and secondly; that of always
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page66" name="page66"></a>66</span>being carried in a sedan-chair by porters, when she went abroad. One
evening she went to a ball, given by the first president of the court of
assizes, a ball at which Ganguernet was also present. She left about
midnight, carried as usual in her sedan-chair through a pelting shower
of rain. At the moment she got under one of those loop-holes in the
eaves-gutters, through which the rain pours down into the street in long
dashing cascades, two or three shrill whistles were heard on the right
and left hand. Immediately four men in masks made their appearance,
at sight of whom the porters, abandoning their charge, took to their
heels; but at the moment when the noble dame believed herself on the
point of being assassinated, a terrible dash of cold water upon her head
took away her breath, and almost deprived her of consciousness. The
top of the chair had disappeared as if by magic, and the gutter poured
its contents directly into the vehicle, the occupant of which in vain attempted
to force open the door. She beat and thumped against it with
fury, mounted the seat, and like an incarnate fiend, invoked the divine
wrath upon the vile miscreants, who were giving her such a cruel
shower-bath; and who only replied to her invectives by profound bows,
and the most humble salutations. The worst part of this wicked trick
was, that the lady wore hair-powder, and the mystifiers carried umbrellas.</p>

<p>My acquaintance with Ganguernet continued about ten years. In
the low and vulgar circles of society which he was fond of frequenting,
he was held up as the most jovial, the best-natured, and the most
amusing fellow in the world; although there were some, whose sense
of propriety and moral feelings were not entirely destroyed, who held
him in merited contempt. For my own part, I always had a dread of
the man. That odious smile, forever hanging on those large red lips,
singularly annoyed me; that imperturbable gayety, exhibited on all occasions
of life, troubled me like the constant presence of a hideous
phantom; that phrase, which he appended like a moral to every thing
he did, that detested phrase, &#8216;A capital joke,&#8217; sounded in my ears as
doleful and sombre as the Trappists&#8217; motto, &#8216;<em>Brother, we must die</em>!&#8217;</p>

<p>There was a fatality about the man; and it was destined that a life
should be sacrificed to his mad propensity for mischief. A day came,
on which his famous words, &#8216;A capital joke!&#8217; was to be pronounced
over a tomb.</p>

<p>On the eve of my departure from Rennes, some friends invited me to
join a hunting-party, of which I learned that Ganguernet was to make
one. This name took from me in advance half the pleasure I had anticipated.
I however repaired early in the morning to the house of one
of our friends, Ernest de B&#8212;&#8212;. On my arrival I found Ganguernet
there with some others of the party. Ernest had just finished a letter,
which he sealed, directed, and placed upon the chimney-piece. Ganguernet,
in his usual inquisitive and impertinent manner, took it up, and
read the direction. &#8216;Ah ha!&#8217; said he; &#8216;so you correspond with your
pretty cousin, do you?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes,&#8217; said Ernest, with an air of indifference; &#8216;I have informed
her that we intend visiting her chateau this evening, at about seven
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page67" name="page67"></a>67</span>o&#8217;clock, to take dinner there. There are fifteen of us I think, and we
shall run some risk of having but poor fare, if she does not get timely
notice.&#8217;</p>

<p>Ernest rang for a servant, and gave him the letter, without any of us
noticing that Ganguernet disappeared for a moment with him. We set
off on our expedition. While engaged in the chase, it so happened that
Ganguernet and myself took one side of the plain on which we were
hunting, while the rest of the party pursued their sport on the other.</p>

<p>&#8216;We shall have some fun this evening,&#8217; said he to me.</p>

<p>&#8216;How so?&#8217; replied I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Would you believe it? I have given a louis to the servant that he
should not carry the letter to its address.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;And have you taken it?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No, pardieu! I told him we were going to have a little joke this
evening, and that he must carry the letter to the lady&#8217;s husband. He
is sitting this moment as president of the court of assizes, and when he
finds that he is going to have fifteen stout fellows, with keen appetites,
at his house this evening, he will be in a devil of a rage. He is as
miserly as Harpagon; and the idea of our laying his kitchen and wine-cellar
under contribution will put him in such a humor, that he will
have no scruple in condemning a dozen innocent men, so that he may
reach his country-house in time to prevent the pillage.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;If this is the case,&#8217; said I to Ganguernet, &#8216;it seems to me to be a
very malicious jest.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Bah! a capital joke! And the best of it will be when we all arrive
at the chateau. The others, ravenous with hunger and thirst, will expect
to find there an excellent supper. But there will be nothing&#8212;absolutely
nothing!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;And do you think, Sir,&#8217; replied I, &#8216;that this will be any pleasanter
to me than to the rest of the party? And you yourself, will you not be
one of the principal dupes of your frolic?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Let me alone for that! Look you here; I&#8217;ve got a cold fowl and
a bottle of Bordeaux in my game-bag, and you shall have half.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I thank you,&#8217; said I, &#8216;but I had rather find Ernest, and notify him of
your trick.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ah! good heavens! my dear Sir,&#8217; said Ganguernet, &#8216;you cannot
take a joke.&#8217;</p>

<p>I left him, and apprising our friends of the affair, inquired where I
could find Ernest. I was told that he had gone in the direction of the
chateau of his cousin, toward which I proceeded, intending to give
Madame de L&#8212;&#8212; notice of the trick of Ganguernet. At a turn of the
road I perceived Ernest at a distance, going toward the chateau. I increased
my speed in order to overtake him, and made so much haste
that I arrived almost at the same moment with him, so that he had just
passed the gate as I reached it. As I was about entering, the gate was
violently pulled to, and immediately I heard the report of a pistol, and
then a voice cried out: &#8216;Villain! since I have missed you, defend
yourself!&#8217;</p>

<p>I hastily sprang to a grating in the wall, about the height of my head,
which opened into the court-yard, and there witnessed a frightful spectacle.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page68" name="page68"></a>68</span>The husband, sword in hand, was attacking Ernest with desperate
fury. &#8216;Ah! you love her and she loves you!&#8217; cried he, in a
voice hoarse with passion; &#8216;you love her, do you? and she loves you!
Your turn first, and then hers!&#8217;</p>

<p>The letter from Ernest to his cousin, conveyed by the malicious interference
of Ganguernet to her husband, had apprised him of a secret
which had remained hidden for more than four years; and before redressing
the wrongs of society as a magistrate, the president of the
court had hastened to avenge his own as a husband.</p>

<p>In vain I cried, in vain I called by name the two cousins. Monsieur de
L&#8212;&#8212; with blind fury drove Ernest from one corner of the court to
another. Suddenly a window opened, and Madame de L&#8212;&#8212;, pale,
with dishevelled hair, and terror painted on her countenance, appeared.</p>

<p>&#8216;Leonie!&#8217; cried Ernest, &#8216;withdraw!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No! let her remain!&#8217; exclaimed Monsieur de L&#8212;&#8212;, &#8216;she is a
prisoner; you need not fear that she will come to separate us.&#8217; And
he again rushed upon his cousin with such fury that the fire flew from
their swords.</p>

<p>&#8216;It is I&#8212;it is <em>I</em> who deserve death!&#8217; cried Madame de L&#8212;&#8212;; &#8216;kill
<em>me</em>!&#8217;</p>

<p>I added my cries to theirs. I shouted, I shook the grating. I tried
to scale the wall, when suddenly, urged on by despair, bewildered, distracted,
Madame de L&#8212;&#8212; threw herself from the window and fell
between her lover and her husband. The latter, completely beside
himself with passion, directed his sword toward her. But Ernest turned
it aside, and in his turn casting off all restraint, exclaimed with vehemence:
&#8216;Madman! would you kill her? Well, then&#8212;defend yourself!&#8217;
And immediately he commenced a violent assault upon his antagonist.</p>

<p>I could do nothing to separate them; neither could Madame de
L&#8212;&#8212;. The unfortunate woman had broken a limb in the fall, and
lay groaning upon the pavement. It was a dreadful combat. Nothing
can express the violent terror which seized me. Already the blood of
the two cousins began to flow, which only served to increase their rage.
I had succeeded with some difficulty in climbing to the top of the wall,
and was about to leap into the court, when I perceived some of our
friends approaching. Ganguernet was at their head; he drew near,
calling to me:</p>

<p>&#8216;Halloo! what&#8217;s this? Why, you bawl like a man getting flayed;
we heard you a quarter of a league off. What the devil is the matter?&#8217;</p>

<p>At the sight of this detested wretch, I rushed upon him, seized him
by the throat, and forcing him violently against the grating, I cried to
him in my turn: &#8216;Look there, miserable jester!&#8212;&#8216;a capital joke!&#8217; is
it not?&#8212;a &#8216;capital joke!&#8221;</p>

<p>Monsieur de L&#8212;&#8212;, pierced through the heart by a plunge of his
antagonist&#8217;s sword, was lying by the side of his wife.</p>

<p>Ernest has left France to die in a foreign land. Madame de L&#8212;&#8212;
committed suicide the day after this horrible duel.</p>

<h2 class="title">THE COUNTRY.</h2>
<p><span class="first_word">There</span> is something very pleasant in the country, particularly about
Thanksgiving-time, when families gather together from north, south,
east and west, around the huge roast turkey, and many pairs of jaws
masticate vigorously in gratitude for blessings received. At this season
of the year the bird which was fortunate enough to excite the enthusiasm
of Brillat-Savarin, and to be the theme of many chapters in his
immortal &#8216;Physiologie,&#8217; is the emblem of our republic. A bald eagle
indeed! Who ever heard of a roast eagle? But a turkey:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&#8216;The state of a fat turkey, the decorum</p>
<p>He marches in with, all the train and circumstance!</p>
<p>&#8217;Tis such a matter, such a glorious matter!</p>
<p>And then his sauce with oranges and onions;</p>
<p>And he displayed in all parts! for such a dish now,</p>
<p>And at my need, I would betray my father.&#8217;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>What native American does not respond <em>Amen!</em> from the depths of
his stomach to these appetizing verses of Beamount and Fletcher? But
higher far rises the gastronomic phrenzy of the Travelled, who have
known the bird, grand in his stuffing of chestnuts, sublime when swelling
with the bliss-bringing truffle!</p>
<p>And the country is at all seasons a pleasant idea, if properly considered;
but beware of the man of one idea, if that one be Country, as you
would of the <i>homo unius libri</i>. If you cannot distinguish timothy from
clover, and beets from carrots; if, agriculturally speaking, you don&#8217;t

whole existence is in the soil. He worships things under the earth.
Dust he is, and to dust he shall return; (the sooner the better!) He
prattles of potatoes, talks of turnips, harangues about horse-radish, knows
no composition except compost. Speak to him of manners, and he will
answer of manures. Like the Egyptians, he worships a bull; and has
all the fondness of Pythagoras for beans. His only literature is Liebig&#8217;s
Animal Chemistry; his lighter reading, the Cultivator and the
New-England Farmer.</p>
<p>Such an one was whilom a citizen with protruding abdomen and white
cravat, who having realized a something in business, exchanges the
counter for the country; buys his acre or two, erects his manor-house,
with a grass-plat in front and a tree or two behind; and with a
little straw hat on his head, a linen coat on his back, and a hoe in his
hand, saunters around his limited possessions, as leisurely and as frequently
as an old horse in a mill, perfectly content with his place, his
plans, and himself.</p>
<p>Call not upon him unless with double-soled boots and strapless trowsers;
and choose a cool day for the visit, if it must be made; for not
over &#8216;hill and dale,&#8217; but over rock and gully you must march; through
ploughed land and through weeds, through bowers of grape-vines and
<i>bosquets</i> of Lima beans; scratched by the thorns of the gooseberry
and brushed by the long dew-covered leaves of the Indian corn. Numberless
shrubs from a foot to eighteen inches in height he will point out to
you, and name them with long names: &#8216;This is the Prota Goras,&#8217; &#8216;and
that the Demo Creitus;&#8217; shrubs which, if you had encountered them
when alone, you might have eradicated as weeds, in a moment of generous
activity. And when muddy, breathless and dripping, you reach
the highest point of his possessions, he will wave his hand majestically
over some twenty feet of grass, and pointing to three trees and a white
fence in the <em>distance</em>, talk of scenery!</p>
<p>Nevertheless, convinced as we are that the taste for country-places
is on the increase, we think it advisable to suggest a few hints for the
instruction of the aspirants after rural felicity. Saratoga and the like
are no longer indispensable places of resort, but it <em>is</em> indispensable to be
out of town for three months of the year, if you would not be out of
fashion during the remaining nine. Select then a bare and stony spot,
for as your object is employment, the more improvements you can make
the better you will be pleased, as you take it for granted of course that
improvements cost almost nothing. On the highest part of this ground
you will build your house: an airy situation is invaluable in warm
weather; and then a view is so desirable. In the choice of a style of
architecture some difficulty arises. You may either have a clap-board
Parthenon, with Corinthian columns in front and Doric columns in the
rear, painted white, to flash back the rays of the sun, or which is perhaps
more fashionable, a Gothic cottage, with steep roof, rustic pillars,
fantastic barge-boards, and numerous pinnacles painted brown, with oak-stained
doors. This style looks well in the situation we have described;
the absence of trees bringing out more fully the beauties of the architecture.
It is attended with one or two inconveniences; scarcely however,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page72" name="page72"></a>72</span>worth mentioning: Gothic windows always leak, and the sloping
roof makes the second story a little <em>ovenish</em> in temperature, and <em>garrety</em>
in smell. Whichever of the two styles you adopt, you must not fail to
refer your plans to some bustling little architect, who will be sure to
write articles about himself in one of the weeklies, and will probably
give a drawing of your house, and call you the &#8216;intelligent, gentlemanly,
and high-minded proprietor.&#8217; After you have removed the stones,
manured the ground, and planted grass, you will have a lawn; and after
you have dug deep holes and set out tall thin consumptive trees, you
have a wood. Secure the whole with white fences; throw rustic bridges
over the <em>impassable</em> streams; sprinkle red dahlias and tiger-lilies here
and there; buy a bull-dog to set on any small child who may be reckless
enough to trespass; and lo! you have a country-seat as well as a
town-house, and can invite your city friends to fill your one spare room
in regular rotation.</p>
<p>In the important matter of a name, you must decide for yourself;
but surely with Walter Scott and Lord Byron and the innumerable
<em>What-d&#8217;ye-call-&#8217;em</em> dales, <em>Thingumbob</em> brooks, and <em>So-and-so</em> woods, to
choose from, you can have no difficulty in fixing upon a suitable one.</p>
<p>But, says an amateur rustic, I have no fondness for floriculture, horticulture,
or agriculture; what am I to do? Buy a horse, and take a
gallop of some twenty miles or so, and if the horse does not shy you off,
or bolt you off, or kick you off, and you do not fall off, or he does not fall
under you, you will probably arrive at home safe; but as you walk from
the stable to the house, you will quote from George Colman&#8217;s parody of
the Lady of the Lake:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&#8216;Hunter rest, for thou must own</p>
<p><em>Leather lost</em> and empty belly,&#8217; etc.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Have you a fondness for fire-arms? Then procure a gun and dog,
and sally forth before day-light. Walk five miles through swamp and
thicket without starting a bird. Sky cloudless; heat intense. Suddenly
dog&#8217;s tail begins to beat half-seconds; up whirrs a bird, who is out of
sight in a moment; so is the dog, who indulges in an animated chase.
You shout yourself hoarse; at length succeed in catching dog, and try to
thresh him with decayed sticks. A little while after, dog comes to a
point again. This time he stands beautifully. You walk slowly up,
trembling with excitement, both barrels cocked. Why don&#8217;t the bird
get up? You glance inquiringly around, and at length discern a
wood-turtle fast asleep near the stump of a tree. Then, if an irascible
man, you curse. So passes the day. Now and then a bird springs; off
fly both of your barrels, aimed at vacancy, and hurling showers of
No. 8 into space; and you arrive at home late in the afternoon, sore-footed
from much travel and stiffness of boots, and alas! without a feather
except a small quail which your dog caught in his mouth.</p>
<p>No more shooting? Try fishing then. Sit all day on a rock watching
your float, or cork, or <i>dobber</i>, as the Dutch boys call it, dance merrily
over the waves, occasionally disappearing under the surface, when
the hook catches a weed. Does not even this suit you? Then, dear
friend, buy a boat of from four to six tons burthen, properly rigged and
ballasted; also buy a red shirt, a small low-crowned straw hat, some
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page73" name="page73"></a>73</span>tar to smear over your hands, and learn the first stanza of &#8216;The sea! the
sea!&#8217; to make every thing seem more nautical and ship-shape. Hoist
jib and mainsail, and venture out. After you have drifted a mile or
two, it will fall a dead calm, and the boat (Gazelle? Wave? Gull?)
will float two or three hours, the sun flashing back from the glassy surface
of the water, burning your face to the color of bricks, and almost
frying the eyes out of your head. Then is the time to sing &#8216;The sea! the
sea!&#8217; and to take some Monongahela to still the qualmishness you begin to
experience. At length the wind rises, and your boat, after many <i>yawings</i>,
dashes away before it. Suddenly, without any voluntary or visible
agency on your part, the main-boom sweeps from one side to the other,
carrying your hat overboard in its passage, and dipping the gunwale deep
under water. Agitated by this significant gesture, you steer straight
for the wharf. In attempting to round-to, the bowsprit comes in contact
with the piles and renounces its allegiance to the bow. The boat drifts
away from the landing, and finally deposits you high and dry on the
beach.</p>
<p>What! Disgusted with this, too? Then take our advice, and like
a reasonable man, stay in town.</p>

<h2 class="title">LITERARY NOTICES.</h2>
<p class="work_reviewed"><span class="special_name">History of the Conquest of Mexico</span>, with a Preliminary View of the Ancient Mexican Civilization,
and the Life of the Conqueror, <span class="special_name">Hernando Cortes</span>. By <span class="special_name">William H. Prescott</span>. In three
volumes. New-York: <span class="special_name">Harper and Brothers</span>.</p>

<p><span class="first_word">We</span> have awaited the appearance of these very elegant volumes with deep and anxious
interest. The ability, industry and taste which the author displayed in his &#8216;History of
Ferdinand and Isabella,&#8217; which won for him a noble reputation in the most cultivated states
of Europe, still more endeared his name to his own countrymen, and led them to look, with
the highest hope and the most pleasant anticipations, to the future efforts of his elegant and
fascinating pen. We have for some time known that he was assiduously engaged in collecting
materials, and preparing from them a history of the famous Conquest of Mexico;
an event which, although of a very splendid and romantic character, was still but
vaguely known, even in accomplished and well-informed literary circles. The facts relating
to it were nowhere recorded in an authentic and connected form; for it has not been
until within the last fifty years that the attention of historians and general scholars has
been turned in this direction. The labors of Spanish antiquarians since that time, conducted
as they have been with great skill and industry, and under the supervision and encouragement
of the government itself, have been abundantly rewarded; and a vast number of original
documents have been accumulated in the public and private libraries, which shed floods
of light upon all historical events connected with the conquests of Spanish armies, or the
discoveries of Spanish fleets, and have thus placed within the reach of writers at the present
day materials for lack of which even the able histories of <span class="special_name">Robertson</span> and his contemporaries
became meagre and unattractive. The historians of our era are making the best
possible use of these copious and invaluable collections. The first result of their efforts was
<span class="special_name">Washington Irving&#8217;s</span> magnificent &#8216;Life of <span class="special_name">Columbus</span>,&#8217; one of the most polished and
perfect works of its class in the English language, and which has done as much for American
literature abroad as it has for its eminent author at home. Then followed <span class="special_name">Prescott&#8217;s</span>
&#8216;Ferdinand and Isabella,&#8217; pronounced by the best critics on both sides the Atlantic to be
one of the most interesting and valuable histories ever published: and here we have, in his
&#8216;History of the Conquest of Mexico,&#8217; drawn from the same rich source, a work eminently
worthy to succeed its brilliant and most &#8216;illustrious predecessors.&#8217;</p>

<p>Within the limits which restrain us, we can of course do nothing more than intimate very
vaguely the general character and scope of this great work; nor are we sure that even this
is not quite a useless labor, as it must find its way at once into the library of every literary
gentleman throughout the country, and be read with the greatest avidity by men of every
class. One of the most valuable portions of the history is the extended view which Mr.
<span class="special_name">Prescott</span> has presented, at the opening of the work, of the character and civilization of the
ancient inhabitants of Mexico. The Spaniards conquered no tribe of untutored savages,
roaming, in the wild lawlessness of the aborigines of our section of the western continent,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page75" name="page75"></a>75</span>over the sunny plains and smiling fields of Anahuac: they found a people there who,
centuries before the discovery of the western world by Columbus, possessed the arts of
civilization, and had reached a point of intellectual and moral culture in many respects surpassing
that of the most renowned nations of the other world. We are surprised to find the
high degree of refinement which they had reached. The sciences, especially of mathematics
and astronomy, were understood to a degree of nicety scarcely attained by the Romans
in their palmiest days. Their political organization was of a wonderfully perfect character;
and their laws, and especially the organization of the judiciary, the department by
which they were to be interpreted and administered, were stamped by a clear insight into
the nature of moral obligation, and the mutual duties and rights of the members of society,
which strike us with the utmost astonishment. Their mythology, with the single exception
of the sanction it gives to human sacrifices, indicates a much nearer approach to a
knowledge of the true God than the popular faith of the Greeks or Romans; and sentiments
are recorded as having been uttered by a prince of the Tezcucan tribe, guided solely by
the light of his own indwelling reason, which were worthy of Plato or of any sage that has
ever lived, unenlightened by the hopes of revelation on which Christians build their faith.
The history of such a people, dwelling centuries ago upon our own continent, shrouded as
it has heretofore been in darkness and vague uncertainty, under the lucid and brilliant pen
of Mr. <span class="special_name">Prescott</span> becomes more attractive than any offspring of the fancy or imaginative
fiction could possibly be. This preliminary sketch occupies nearly half of the first volume;
and we have never read any similar effort of the same extent with equal gratification.</p>

<p>We can of course give no outline of the main portion of the work, the history of the
train of events by which the whole Mexican empire fell into the hands of the conquering
Spaniard. It is one of the most romantic narratives which ever bore the seal of truth. Its
prominent actors are men of eminent genius, who performed exploits worthy the greatest captains
of Europe or Asia; and the history of their lives abounds with interest and instruction.
Mr. <span class="special_name">Prescott</span> has a most happy historical style, glowing with all the warmth and shining
with a far more substantial brilliancy than that of <span class="special_name">Bancroft</span>; and blending the strict truth
of accurate narrative with the free flow of a fine imagination, all under the control of an
exquisite taste, with more success than that of any other American writer, <span class="special_name">Irving</span> perhaps
alone excepted. The authorities upon which he relies for his facts are uniformly
given in notes, and the fullest information is presented in the same form, on all points which
concern the accuracy and completeness of the work. We read the following passage in our
author&#8217;s preface with profound regret: &#8216;For one thing, I may reasonably ask the reader&#8217;s indulgence.
Owing to the state of my eyes, I have been obliged to use a writing-case made for
the blind, which does not permit the writer to see his own manuscript; nor have I ever corrected,
or even read, my own original draft.&#8217; Mr. <span class="special_name">Prescott</span> may well consider this as an
ample excuse for any errors of typography; of which, by the way, we have not discovered
even one. We were already aware, on the best authority, that <span class="special_name">Washington Irving</span> had
prepared to take up the ground so ably occupied by our author; a fact to which Mr. Prescott
alludes in the following graceful terms:</p>

<div class="quotation">
<p>&#8216;It was not till I had become master of my rich collection of materials, that I was acquainted with
this circumstance; and had he persevered in his design, I should unhesitatingly have abandoned my
own, if not from courtesy, at least from policy; for though armed with the weapons of Achilles, this
could give me no hope of success in a competition with Achilles himself. But no sooner was that distinguished
writer informed of the preparations I had made, than with the gentlemanly spirit which will
surprise no one who has the pleasure of his acquaintance, he instantly announced to me his intention of
leaving the subject open to me. While I do but justice to Mr. <span class="special_name">Irving</span> by this statement, I feel the
prejudice it does to myself in the unavailing regret I am exciting in the bosom of the reader.&#8217;</p>
</div>

<p>We cannot take leave of this splendid book without making mention of the truly elegant
style in which it has been issued by its liberal publishers. It yields in no respect to the
finest issue of the Boston, and we had almost added, of the London press. The three volumes
are large octavo, of about five hundred pages each, containing elegant portraits and
illustrative maps; and yet the whole is sold for six dollars!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page76" name="page76"></a>76</span></p>

<p class="work_reviewed"><span class="special_name">The Ã†neid of Virgil, with English Notes, Critical and Explanatory</span>; a Metrical Clavis
and an Historical, Geographical and Mythological Index. By <span class="special_name">Charles Anthon</span>, LL. D. New-York:
<span class="special_name">Harper and Brothers</span>.</p>

<p><span class="first_word">The</span> cause of sound classical education in America is more deeply indebted to Professor
<span class="special_name">Anthon</span> than to any other scholar in the country; and the debt of gratitude already incurred
is almost daily increased by the unwearied efforts of this distinguished linguist.
Beside the voluminous and unequalled Dictionaries which he has compiled and published,
he has in course of preparation a series of the most popular Latin authors, in which his
principal aim is to adapt them to the use of scholars in our academies and higher schools.
Another volume of this series, containing the Ã†neid, has just been issued. It is usually
among the earliest Latin works placed in the pupil&#8217;s hands, and yet there are few which
require a more intimate and extended acquaintance with Roman history, domestic habits,
mythology, geography, and indeed with every thing relating to the Romans as a nation and
society, in order to a perfect understanding of its character, and a genuine relish of its beauties,
than this. We doubt the policy, or propriety indeed, of placing in the hands of those
who are learning the elements of a foreign <em>language</em>, poems of an elaborate and elevated
character for text-books. No one, for the purpose of learning English, would take up <span class="special_name">Milton&#8217;s</span>
Paradise Lost before the Vicar of Wakefield or <span class="special_name">Bunyan&#8217;s</span> Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress; for aside
from the fact that he would not thus be introduced to the simple dialect of ordinary life, its
classical and doctrinal allusions, its technical terms, and the profound knowledge of men, of
books, and of nature which it embraces, would render it almost a sealed volume to any but
those who have already become cultivated and accomplished scholars. And although the
case is materially different in learning the ancient languages, since the object is not to speak
or write them, but to become familiar with the great works which are written in them, it would
be unwise if not useless to teach a pupil to read <span class="special_name">Virgil</span> without at the same time providing
him with the means of thoroughly understanding and appreciating his poetry. For these he
is usually dependent upon the verbal expositions of his teacher, who, even if he chance to
be well qualified for the task, seldom has sufficient time for its proper discharge.</p>

<p>Many attempts have been made to supply this want, and some of them have been attended
with very fair, though not full, success. <span class="special_name">Cooper&#8217;s</span> edition has had the most copious notes,
but they are not always accurate, and are often upon passages of comparatively little difficulty.
<span class="special_name">Gould&#8217;s</span> notes are better, but they are much more sparingly introduced, and do not
indeed elucidate the really intricate points. The historical and mythological references in
both these editions are quite scanty; and they must both in our judgment speedily give place
to this of Dr. <span class="special_name">Anthon</span>. The critical and explanatory notes to this are all that could be
desired. They occupy more than six hundred pages, or quite two-thirds of the book, and
relate to every point of interest or of doubt in the whole Ã†neid. They are full, accurate,
and perfectly satisfactory. The author tells us in the preface that they comprise the results
of all the study and research of modern European scholars, and embrace every thing which
has been brought to light up to the present time. They are very copiously and clearly
illustrated by neat and perspicuous engravings, which frequently do more than pages of
description to give a distinct impression to the scholar&#8217;s mind. The construction of Roman
ships, the mode of a naval battle, the style of conducting a siege, the form of chaplets, of
temples, of household utensils, of coins, ornaments, and in fine, the exact structure and appearance
of every thing pertaining to Roman history or Roman life, are thus rendered more
familiar to the eye than they ever could be to the ear of the student. The metrical clavis
scans all the difficult lines contained in the book, and the general index clearly and briefly
elucidates all the references which the poem contains to men, incidents, and localities.
With these recommendations, aided by the typographical clearness and beauty which the
publishers have given to it, this edition of the Ã†neid must be heartily welcomed by scholars
and students (all rivalry to the contrary) throughout the United States.</p>

<p class="work_reviewed"><span class="special_name">Mexico: as it Was and as it Is</span>. By <span class="special_name">Brantz Mayer</span>, Late Secretary of Legation to Mexico. In
one volume, octavo, pp. 426. &#8216;New World&#8217; press: J. <span class="special_name">Winchester</span>.</p>

<p><span class="first_word">We</span> looked through a large portion of this work while all its sheets were not yet through
the press, and were enabled with some confidence to predict that it would create no small
sensation in the literary world. Mr. <span class="special_name">Mayer</span> has a free, unpretending style, which renders
all that he writes eminently <em>readable</em>; a merit in which many far more practised writers
are as signally deficient. The programme furnished in the announcement of the work has
been well filled up. Many of the ruins and antiquities here described have never before
been visited or mentioned by any traveller. A detailed account is furnished of the present
social and political condition of Mexico; an elaborate description is given of the antiquities
to be found in the museum of the capital, and of the ancient remains strewn from
California to Odjaca. A record is presented of the author&#8217;s journeys to Tezcoco, and
through the <i>tierra-caliente</i>; and a full account of the agriculture, manufactures, commerce,
resources, mines, coinage, and general statistics of Mexico is given. There is beside a
complete view of the past and present <em>history</em> of the country, with vivid pictures of the domestic
manners and customs of the people. The whole is illustrated by numerous drawings
from the pencil of Mr. <span class="special_name">Mayer</span>, which have been engraved on wood by <span class="special_name">Butler</span>, in that
excellent artist&#8217;s best style. We scarcely remember to have met with a work so profusely
embellished; and the literary and pictorial artist being one and the same person, the reader
is helped to a far more life-like view of the scenes and things described and depicted than
he could have obtained under circumstances less favorable to the strict fidelity of pen and
pencil. The publisher has evinced great liberality in the pictorial department of the volume,
having expended upward of twelve hundred dollars on the illustrations alone. The volume
is printed upon a fine and white (though somewhat too thin) paper, with a large clear type.
The work can scarcely fail to attain, what indeed it well deserves, a wide diffusion.</p>

<p class="work_reviewed"><span class="special_name">Scenes and Scenery in the Sandwich Islands, and a Trip through Central America</span>:
being Observations from my Note-book, during the years 1837, to 1842. By <span class="special_name">James J. Jarves</span>, Member
of the Oriental Society, etc. In one vol. pp. 341. Boston: <span class="special_name">Jas. Munroe and Company</span>.</p>

<p><span class="first_word">Those</span> of our readers who may have seen a previous work of Mr. <span class="special_name">Jarves</span>, on the history
of the Sandwich Islands, which was noticed in this Magazine, will perhaps remember the
following passage in the preface: &#8216;It was designed to interweave with the civil and political
account of the nation, a series of sketches, illustrative of their present life and condition,
and other interesting points, which would have enlivened a bare narrative of facts; also to
have pictured the wondrous natural phenomena of that prolific portion of the Pacific, the
great volcanic eruption of 1840; and a full account of the mightiest of craters, the gigantic
<i>Lua Pele</i>, of Kilanea, in Hawaii. But it would have swelled the volume to an unwieldy
size. At an early period will be presented an additional volume, which, without being connected
with the present, will give in detail all that is necessary to form a correct view of
the Hawaiian Islands, their condition, prospects, the every-day concerns of the people, and
missionary life as it now exists; the two to form a succinct whole, illustrating each other.&#8217;
The volume before us has been written in fulfilment of the foregoing pledge. In it the writer
has attempted to delineate that which came within his immediate observation, during
a residence of four years on the Group. As a description of the familiar life of a people,
in a novel and interesting position, one which may with propriety be termed a state of transition
from barbarism to civilization, it will attract the attention, and interest the sympathies
of readers of all classes. A portion of the sketches have been previously published in journals,
and had some circulation both at home and abroad. The volume is executed by the
eminent Boston printer, <span class="special_name">Dickinson</span>, and is illustrated with fine maps and plates.</p>

<p>Expect it not! Time, pain, and grief</p>
<p>Have made thee like an autumn leaf;</p>
<p>Ready, by blast or self-decay,</p>
<p>From its slight hold to drop away;</p>
<p>And some sad morn may gild thy bier,</p>
<p>Long, long before another year!</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>&#8216;Another year! another year!</p>
<p>Oh! who shall see another year?</p>
<p>Shall you, ye young? or you, ye fair?</p>
<p>Ah! the presumptuous thought forbear!</p>
<p>Beside this church-yard&#8217;s peaceful bounds,</p>
<p>Pause ye, and ponder o&#8217;er the mounds:</p>
<p>Here beauty sleeps; that verdant length</p>
<p>Of grave contains what once was strength;</p>
<p>The child, the boy, the man are here&#8212;</p>
<p>Ye may not see another year!&#8217;</p></div>
</div>
<p>While however we give to emotions like these their appropriate vent, we are not called
upon to forget that there is much that is inspiring and delightful in the commencement of
the year. The time-honored custom of our metropolis has made it a point of peculiar radiance;
a halcyon period, when heart&#8217;s-ease would seem to be the general feeling, and
smiles the social insignia. Then the visit is exchanged between friends whom perhaps
the departed year had somewhat alienated; old associations are revived, and cordialities
that had well nigh been forgotten are strengthened and renewed. As the lip is wetted with
friendly wine, the bosom expands in the generous warmth of honest enjoyment; the cold
formalities of factitious station give place to undisguised welcome and open-handed cheer.
The rich and the poor meet together, and the spirit of pleasure is with all. As the parties
go their rounds, and familiar forms and faces appear to greeting eyes, the <em>necessity</em> of friendship
and the desolation of its absence come home to the mind. It is felt that comfort
is lost when allied to selfishness, and that it is good to be respected or beloved. And as
those meet between whom the year has passed in sullen estrangement; upon whose anger
many an evening sun has descended; a relenting spirit obeys the mingled voices of Memory
and Friendship: the kind resolve is made and followed; so that instead of the thorn to goad
and wound, there springs up in the pathway of the Reconciled the olive or the myrtle. How
sweet is the sight of human goodness, struggling to surmount the petty passions which discolor
its beauty, and bending to the benign suggestions of that pure and gentle principle,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page79" name="page79"></a>79</span><em>peace with man</em>! Doubtless there are many severe strivings with natural pride, before
these ends can be reached; but the new year awakens such throngs of conciliatory sentiments,
that it is impossible to resist them. The call is made; the oversight or neglect explained;
the breach is closed; and friendship is paramount! Months of reverses and cares
and disappointments are lost in that initial day, whose span is golden from sun to sun; a
lapse to be remembered with quiet satisfaction in trials to come. Indeed, a moment&#8217;s reflection
will assure any contemplative mind that resentment is the most pitiful passion that
can agitate the human breast. True, there is such a thing as &#8216;<em>spirit</em>,&#8217; but how often is it ill-directed!
How often magnified by little causes into an importance wholly incommensurate
with the object desired! It is the province of new-year visits to crush these poisonous
weeds of our path, to quench their noxious tendrils, and to substitute in their stead the balm
of friendship and good-will. For such an object the morning of the year is most auspicious.
The grand festival of our <span class="special_name">Saviour&#8217;s</span> nativity has but lately ended, and a preservation of the
era of good feeling is enjoined both by Precept and Hope. Who can resist such appeals
to that kindness which increases the happiness of its possessor? With these reiterated
words of counsel and of affection, let us take present leave of our readers, by wishing them
in hackneyed phrase, but with unhackneyed spirit, a <span class="special_name">Happy
New-Year</span>!</p>

<p><span class="ed_table_title">The Rights of Women.</span>&#8212;We wish it were possible to transfer to this printed page
the beautiful chirography of the annexed communication, which proceeds from the pen of
a lady who, with a few others of her gentle sex, sat out the reading of the lecture upon the
&#8216;<em>Rights of Women</em>,&#8217; by Mr. <span class="special_name">John Neal</span>, at the Broadway Tabernacle last winter, and
which was so heartily laughed at by the press and the town for a day or two after. It is
gratifying to remark that <em>women</em> themselves have been the prominent satirists of the characteristic
absurdities put forth on the occasion alluded to. But to our fair correspondent:
&#8216;<span class="special_name">Appear</span>, bright Spirits of the ancient Nine! (for you were women, and can well appreciate
my appeal) arrayed in all the panoply of your charms! Thou, <span class="special_name">Minerva</span>! aid me with
thy wisdom! Ye, most lovely <span class="special_name">Graces</span>! attend me with the power of honey-like persuasiveness!
And thou, <span class="special_name">John Neal</span>! arrayed in the drapery of the softer sex, gracefully to
maintain the lofty eminence whereon thou standest, assist me with the glorious power of
thy overwhelming eloquence, while I assert the high prerogative of Woman! Yet when I
dwell on the brilliant efforts accomplished by thy mighty genius in our behalf, the pen falls
powerless from my despairing hand, and I can merely point to thee as the potent champion
of our down-trodden rights! Instead of dwelling in dull obscurity, victims to the caprice of
men; mending their thread-bare clothing and scolding servants&#8212;base, unwomanly pursuits!&#8212;instead
of listening in silence to the storms of political debate; instead of remaining
within the shadow of our own roofs, and gathering around the domestic hearth the
thornless roses of existence; rendering home a haven of rest to the weary and care-worn;
instead of slumbering idly, in the security of our mansions, when the torrent of war
rolls over the land; instead of girding then our brothers for the stormy fight, bidding them
<span class="special_name">God</span>-speed; instead of ignobly bending before the tyrannical power of Man, thou, O! astute
<span class="special_name">Neal</span>! wouldst have us pluck the laurel-wreath from our kinsman&#8217;s brow, and bind it on
our own. Thou wouldst have us rise in all the dignity of offended &#8216;equality,&#8217; and boldly
assert the holy right of &#8216;<em>free suffrage to all</em>!&#8217; Why, forsooth, should <em>we</em> rather be confined to
the narrow circle of home than our friends of the other sex? Are we not as capable of
sounding the loud alarm of war, of mingling in the strife and tumult of the battle-hour, as
the ladies of antique Amazonia, or the warrior-<em>men</em> of our own day? Have we not intellect
enough to cope with the <span class="special_name">Websters</span>, the <span class="special_name">Clays</span>, and the <span class="special_name">Wrights</span>, in the halls of Congress?
Is not our dignity sufficient to maintain, with honor to our country and ourselves,
the various offices of the government? Why may not our superior talents elevate us to
the lofty station of the presidential chair?&#8212;to become Ambassadresses, Generalesses,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page80" name="page80"></a>80</span>Stateswomen? Surely our intellect is as lofty, as noble, and as clear as that in which proud
man exults. Arise then, Women of America! Study immediately the tactics of military
discipline; proceed to the green savannahs of Florida; wrest their authority from those
who now possess it, and deck your own brows of loveliness with the wreaths of conquest
and of glory. March to the halls of legislation; demand from statesmen there assembled
the concession of &#8216;woman&#8217;s rights,&#8217; and desert them not till that &#8216;vantage ground&#8217;
is well secured. Then, ladies, will you be enabled to cast aside with disdain the bonds
of domestic confinement, which insure merely your peace and happiness; to mingle your
shrill cries with the tumult of contending armies, confounding confusion itself with your
loud clamors! You may then unite your voices with the shouts of opposing factions at the
momentous periods of election, huzzaing for your candidates, and gathering all your influence
to win success for them. So shall you nobly fulfil the high destiny allotted you, instead
of longer enduring the degrading cares attendant on the happiness of your fathers&#8217;
and your husbands&#8217; homes. So shall you take by storm the hearts of men as well as the
citadels of your enemies; forcing them to admire those female &#8216;braves&#8217; who so kindly relieve
them of the weighty burden of their cares.&#8217; Capital! This mock-heroic is just the
vein for a theme so ridiculous as the insane crudities here touched upon. By the by; a private
note advises us that &#8216;there have been recent symptoms of chuckling exhibited by the
&#8216;champion of women,&#8217; on the supposition, real or assumed, that the attention of the legislatures
of several States had been diverted toward &#8216;woman&#8217;s rights&#8217; in the matter of personal
property between man and wife, by reason of the lecture aforesaid!&#8217; It is unnecessary
perhaps to add, in justice to the public sense, that the action of three or four States
upon this subject had a far different origin, as their legislative records will abundantly
show.</p>

<p><span class="ed_table_title">Ole Bull</span>.&#8212;We confess ourselves among the uninitiated in the mysteries of music.
We are quite aware that it is not a little dangerous for one who would not lose <em>caste</em> in society
to assert that he does not greatly admire that ill-assorted compound of &#8216;<em>strains</em>&#8217; which
is usually designated by the hackneyed phrases of &#8216;brilliant execution&#8217; and &#8216;difficult passages;&#8217;
passages which Dr. <span class="special_name">Johnson</span> wished were &#8216;not only <em>difficult</em> but <em>impossible</em>:&#8217; we
cannot force an admiration nor affect an enthusiasm which we do not feel. Indeed, we
have always had great sympathy for the amateur of fashion who aspired to great refinement
of taste, to exhibit which, in one branch of art, he gave on one occasion an entertainment
of instrumental music. While the musicians were <em>all</em> at work, he seemed delighted with
the performance; but when one instrument chanced to be engaged upon a solo, he inquired,
in a towering passion, why the others were remaining idle? &#8216;It is a <em>pizzicato</em> for one instrument,&#8217;
replied the operator. &#8216;I can&#8217;t help that,&#8217; replied the virtuoso; &#8216;let the trumpets
<em>pizzicato</em> along with you; they&#8217;re <em>paid</em> to do it!&#8217; Now in regard to musical knowledge and
taste, this hopeful amateur has many a counterpart in this day and generation, and in this
same city of Gotham. In the case of <span class="special_name">Ole Bull</span>, however, there has been no call for
<em>affected</em> admiration. He has <em>compelled</em> not only admiration but enthusiasm; not indeed by
mere artistical &#8216;execution,&#8217; although in this he is acknowledged to be preÃ«minent, but by
the creations of <em>genius</em>, which &#8216;take the full heart captive.&#8217; Let the distant reader imagine
an audience of three thousand persons awaiting in breathless expectance the entrance
upon the Park-stage of this great Master. The curtain rises, and after the lapse of a moment,
a tall manly person, with a frank, ingenuous expression of countenance, emerges
with an embarrassed salutation from the wing, and with another somewhat less constrained,
stands in front of the orchestra, the focus of every eye and glass in that brilliant assemblage.
Pausing for a brief space, as if to collect himself, he raises his bow, and with a slight
motion, beckons to each member of the orchestra in turn, who &#8216;start into sound&#8217; at his bidding
as if touched by the wand of <span class="special_name">Ithuriel</span>. When the tide of harmony has reached its
flood, and is gradually ebbing back to fainter sounds, the Master raises his instrument to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page81" name="page81"></a>81</span>his shoulder and lays his ear upon it, as if listening for his key-note amidst the tones that
are serpentining through his brain. When to the audience &#8216;nothing lives &#8217;twixt these and
silence,&#8217; a strain which has at first a dying fall imperceptibly swells on the ear. It is <em>the</em>
instrument, beyond all peradventure; and from that moment you are &#8216;all ear.&#8217; While you
are wondering why you never knew before that there was such a <em>volume</em> of sound in a
violin, a passage of infinite pathos arrests your <em>heart</em>, and you find your eyes moistening
under its influence. It subsides into tremulous tones that retreat farther and farther from
the ear, until they seem to come from a mile&#8217;s distance; anon, they begin to approach again,
and swelling gradually upon the &#8216;aching sense,&#8217; almost overpower you with their fulness of
melody. This transcendent effort of genius reminded us of the phantasmagora, or &#8216;magic
lantern;&#8217; for what the lessening and enlarging figures of that instrument are to the <em>eye</em>, <span class="special_name">Ole
Bull&#8217;s</span> magic sounds are to the <em>ear</em>. We had intended to allude in detail to several of the
performances of this great Master; but we lack the requisite space. We can only instance
the &#8216;Norwegian Rondo,&#8217; the &#8216;Themes from <span class="special_name">Bellini</span>,&#8217; and the &#8216;Carnival at Venice,&#8217; as
eminently justifying the fervent enthusiasm which they excited. It was no unnatural
combination of splendid sinuosities, of small notes split into hexagonals, and attenuated into
tremors that were &#8216;no great <em>shakes</em>&#8217; after all, which entranced the audience; it was full,
rich tones; it was melody, harmony, that won their loud and almost irrepressible applause.
We have not yet had the pleasure to hear <span class="special_name">Vieux-Temps</span>, the distinguished violinist recently
arrived among us. His numerous friends and countrymen in the metropolis rank him even
above <span class="special_name">Ole Bull</span>. We are inclined, however, to trust the comparison made by an eminent
brother-artist, who assisted at his first concert: &#8216;<span class="special_name">Vieux-Temps</span>,&#8217; said he, &#8216;is a very
accomplished <em>artist</em>; but <span class="special_name">Ole Bull</span> is a magnificent <em>genius</em>.&#8217; We shall have something to
say of <span class="special_name">Vieux-Temps</span>, <span class="special_name">Artot</span>, and Sig. <span class="special_name">Cassela</span>, in a subsequent number of the <span class="special_name">Knickerbocker</span>,

<p><span class="ed_table_title">A Second &#8216;Ralph Ringwood.&#8217;</span>&#8212;We have a western correspondent, a &#8216;man of mark&#8217;
in his region, and far from unknown elsewhere, who has seen a good deal of the world, and
whose entertaining epistles always remind us of the graphic &#8216;<em>Experiences of Ralph Ringwood</em>,&#8217;
as recorded in these pages by <span class="special_name">Washington Irving</span>. Here is a fragment of youthful
reminiscence, fresh from his mint, &#8216;which it is hoped may please;&#8217; and if it <em>does</em>, we will
use our &#8216;selectest influence&#8217; to induce him to write out for us a series of papers containing
his complete autobiography, which we have good reason to believe would overflow with
romance and strange vicissitude: &#8216;I was raised,&#8217; he writes, &#8216;as we western folks term it,
in a small village some fifteen miles from Boston, and when about sixteen years of age I paid
a visit to the metropolis for the first time in my life. When I first arrived there I spent some
hours in trying to hunt up an old play-mate who had been bound apprentice to a Boston
mechanic some two years previous. I could hear nothing of him, however, and so gave
up the search. But one day, while sauntering down the main-street, and wondering at all
I saw, I suddenly encountered a strange sight. It was <em>a sheep</em>, dead and dressed, but moving
along the side-walk in an upright position, and apparently without help! Puzzled at this
phenomenon, I turned round as it passed me, in order to observe it more closely; when to
my astonishment I discovered a boy behind it, who with the sheep on his back was shuffling
along the walk, stern-foremost. I was still more astonished when I recognized in this lad
my old and long-sought playmate. &#8216;<span class="special_name">Dick</span>, my boy!&#8217; said I, grasping his hand warmly.
<span class="special_name">Dick</span> seemed a little embarrassed at first; but after a moment&#8217;s hesitation, he threw down
his load spitefully, and seizing my hand returned my grasp as cordially as it had been given.
&#8216;For <span class="special_name">God</span>&#8217;s sake, <span class="special_name">Dick</span>,&#8217; inquired I, &#8216;how long is it since you commenced walking backward?&#8217;
&#8216;Not a great while,&#8217; replied he, with a grin. &#8216;To tell you the truth, <span class="special_name">Frank</span>, I saw
you looking in the jeweller&#8217;s window there, and knew you at once; and as I didn&#8217;t care to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page82" name="page82"></a>82</span>be seen by an old comrade with a sheep on my back, I was in hopes to escape your observation
by walking in the manner in which you saw me.&#8217; &#8216;And that was the very thing which
led me to discover you,&#8217; I replied; &#8216;you might have passed me in the ordinary way, nineteen
times in every twenty, without being recognized.&#8217; &#8216;Well, it&#8217;s all one now, since you
have found me out,&#8217; said <span class="special_name">Dick</span>. &#8216;But what, after all, are you going to do with that measly-looking
animal?&#8217; I inquired. &#8216;Eat it,&#8217; replied he, with a comical twist of the nose; &#8216;I have
to lug one home every day; we apprentices live on them altogether. I&#8217;m a sheep myself,
almost; <em>b-a-a-h</em>!&#8217; and here he imitated the cry of that animal so naturally, that I had no
doubt of the truth of his statement. After a few moments&#8217; conversation, chiefly about
home, the clock struck ten, when <span class="special_name">Dick</span> suddenly resumed his load, and after giving me the
directions to the &#8216;old man&#8217;s&#8217; house, and exacting a promise to call and see him in the evening,
he started for home. At the appointed hour in the evening, I called to see him, as
agreed upon, and found him waiting for me. But what a different-looking personage from
the one I met in the morning! He was now very smartly dressed in a small black frock-coat,
and drab gaiter-trowsers strapped tightly over a pair of nicely-polished boots. On his head
a black velvet cap, from which two enormous tassels were swinging, was setting jauntily on
one side, while in his hand he carried a little silver-headed cane, with which he occasionally
rapped his legs. In my unsophisticated eyes he was a very paragon of gentility, and I
couldn&#8217;t help contrasting him with my own countrified appearance. However, I had but
a moment for reflection; for sallying into the street, with me at his heels, <span class="special_name">Dick</span> at once proposed
going to the theatre. I agreed without hesitation, for the big play-bills had been
staring me in the face all day, and on them were emblazoned in large capitals the names of
<span class="special_name">Cooper</span> and <span class="special_name">Finn</span>, who were to play together that evening in one of <span class="special_name">Shakspeare&#8217;s</span> comedies.
When we arrived at the play-house, <span class="special_name">Dick</span> took me aside, and pointing to the little
window in the office, proposed that I should go and purchase the tickets; &#8216;because,&#8217; said
he, &#8216;the box-keeper knows me.&#8217; I couldn&#8217;t exactly comprehend why the fact of his being
known to the box-keeper should prevent his purchasing the tickets himself. However, I
supposed it was all right, and so I crowded up to the little window, and after awaiting my
turn, obtained two pit-tickets, for which I had to pay out of my own pocket, of course.
Dick took them from me when I returned, and then again resuming the lead, he conducted
me into the lobby of the play-house. Here he handed the tickets to the door-keeper, at
the same time nodding his head toward me, in order to intimate to that gentleman that I
was under his special patronage, and that the other admission was intended for me. Once
seated in the centre of the pit, <span class="special_name">Dick</span> seemed to be in his glory. He ogled the ladies in the
boxes, and whistled and shouted and stamped, and cried &#8216;Physic!&#8217; until I thought he would
split his throat. But when at last the gloomy curtain rose and the stars of the evening
stood glittering before us, he clapped and shouted so much louder and longer than all the
rest, that the whole audience gazed at him with admiration. He would have gone on applauding,
I verily believe, until the end of the play, had not a tall gentleman, with a red
handkerchief round his throat, and carrying a long pole, rapped him over the head, and
peremptorily shouted &#8216;Silence!&#8217; From that moment <span class="special_name">Dick</span> was as mute as a Quaker, until
the end of the play; when rushing out and dragging me after him, he proposed that we
should go and finish the evening at a celebrated coffee-house, kept by &#8216;a particular friend
of his,&#8217; and where he had agreed to meet some half-dozen fellow-apprentices. Here we
stayed until a very late hour, drinking and smoking, telling stories and singing songs. As
it grew later, our companions one by one walked or reeled out of the bar-room, until we
two were left the only tenants, save the landlord. The latter then commenced closing the
house, and hinted pretty strongly that it was high time we were going. I turned to <span class="special_name">Dick</span>,
who had been remarkably silent for some time, when to my utter dismay I discovered that
he was perfectly insensible from drink. I looked up to the landlord for counsel. He was
a short, <em>squab</em> man, with a bulbous excresence growing out from between his shoulders, that
I suppose passed for a head, though it looked like a wen; a kind of expletive, to wear a
hat on, or to fill up the hollow of a shabby wig. &#8216;What shall we <em>do</em> with him?&#8217; said I.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page83" name="page83"></a>83</span>&#8216;Hustle him out!&#8217; cried he; &#8216;hustle him out! he didn&#8217;t get his liquor here: I&#8217;ve no room
for such company!&#8217; I then endeavored to put my companion upon his feet, but his legs
bent under him, and his whole body seemed as limber and lifeless as a wet rag. &#8216;You
can&#8217;t do any thing with him in <em>that</em> way,&#8217; continued the landlord; &#8216;if you want to get
him home to-night, you must take him on your back and carry him there yourself. He&#8217;ll
be bright enough in the morning.&#8217; I saw no other way of proceeding; and so, being strong
and athletic myself, while <span class="special_name">Dick</span> was of slight proportions, I managed, with the assistance
of the landlord, to get him upon my back, and then started for his master&#8217;s house. As my
burthen was perfectly speechless, I had plenty of time for uninterrupted thought as I trudged
along; and I couldn&#8217;t help contrasting the apprentice of the morning with the apprentice
of the present moment. <em>Then</em>, though rather coarsely dressed, and smooched with the
marks of labor, he blushed at being caught with a sheep on his back, though he had come
honestly by it; but <em>now</em>, though bedecked in the habiliments of a gentleman, he was being
carried home himself like a beast on the back of a companion. On reaching his master&#8217;s
house I laid him down upon the door-sill, where he commenced breathing intensely through
his nose, while I fumbled round for the handle of the bell, which I rang. The &#8216;old man&#8217;
himself came to the door, and looking down at his apprentice, shook his head sorrowfully.
Then turning to a black domestic, who with a candle in her hand stood grinning behind
him, he said, &#8216;Here&#8217;s <span class="special_name">Dick</span> come home drunk again, Dinah; you must take him up stairs
and get him to bed in the best way you can.&#8217; The old gentleman turned away with a tear
in his eye, and I also departed, leaving <span class="special_name">Dick</span>, who had come to his senses a little, struggling
in the arms of the brawny black, and vainly trying to kiss her polished cheek. Thus ended
my first youthful adventure in a city.&#8217;</p>

not a few comments, pro and con, upon the papers on &#8216;<em>Mind and Instinct</em>,&#8217;
which appeared in the last two numbers of the <span class="special_name">Knickerbocker</span>. Our friend and correspondent,
&#8216;<span class="special_name">Harry Franco</span>,&#8217; among others, in a gossiping epistle to the Editor, writes as
follows:</p>
<div class="gossip_section">
<div class="quotation">
<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">I have</span> been considerably interested in your correspondent&#8217;s paper on mind and instinct; only I
rather wonder at his laboring to prove a theory which few are inclined to question. But he does not
after all, it appears to me, draw the right conclusions from his argument. All living beings have a
mind, or reason, or what you will, which prompts them to do all that their animal functions are capable
of performing. In this respect man is as much governed by instinct as a brute. My neighbor&#8217;s dog
every night when I come home walks up to me, wags his tail, and looks in my face, and says in his
way, &#8216;How are you?&#8217; His master gives me a nod, takes his pipe from his mouth, and says the same.
But when a stranger comes to my door, neither the dog nor his master salutes him; but were he to fall
into the brook, they would both run to pull him out. Are they not both influenced by exactly the same
feelings? If I should ask my neighbor to endorse my note, he would look sulky, hem! and haw! and
refuse; if I should attempt to take a bone from his dog, the brute would snarl and growl, and perhaps
bite me. Do you see any marvellous difference between the two animals? A near neighbor of mine,
about six months since, had a little boy of four years old, who had a spaniel of which he was very fond.
One day during the absence of the father, the child was taken ill with the croup; the mother was
alarmed, and it so happened that her servants were away, and she had no one to send for a physician.
The poor woman was in great tribulation, for in spite of all her efforts the child grew worse. In
about an hour after the child was taken ill, her father&#8217;s carriage stopped at the door, and her mother
made her appearance. Her father&#8217;s house was about two miles distant. The grandmother said that
Carlo, the sick child&#8217;s dog, &#8216;came running into the house, all bespattered with mud, and flew about
and acted so strangely that she knew something must be the matter with little Billy, her grandson, and
she came to see what it was.&#8217; Until then, the mother of the child had not noticed the absence of the
dog from the room, for the boy was playing with him when he was taken sick. The child remained ill
three or four days, and then died; and during the whole time the dog never left his bed-side; he watched
by the corpse until it was buried, and then took possession of the little boy&#8217;s chair, which he would
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page84" name="page84"></a>84</span>allow no one to touch, not even the child&#8217;s mother. Every day he absented himself for three or four
hours; and the father one day going to look at his child&#8217;s grave, found that the dog had almost scratched
his way down to the coffin. He was after this kept within doors; but he refused to eat, and in a
short time died in the chair of his little master. If I had time, I could tell you a story almost as touching,
in relation to a pig, an animal that phrenologically speaking has generally been looked upon as
somewhat deficient in the region of the sentiments.&#8217;</p>

<div class="gossip_section">
<p><span class="first_word">Now</span> that our attention has been awakened to the subject, we find in our casual reading
the testimony in favor of &#8216;mind in animals&#8217; greatly to increase and multiply. <span class="special_name">Oleus
Magnus</span>, Bishop of Norway, in a work written in Latin some two centuries ago, tells us of
a fox that, in order to get rid of the fleas which infested his skin, was accustomed to swim out
into a lake with a straw band held high and dry in his mouth. When the water-hating
vermin had all escaped from his submerged body to the dry straw, down dived Reynard,
leaving his tormentors &#8216;at sea,&#8217; and rising again beyond the scope of safe jumping. &#8216;Curious,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8217; A correspondent at Rochester, &#8216;who experienced much satisfaction in the
perusal of the article&#8217; above alluded to, was yet &#8216;a little dissatisfied with the closing portion
of it.&#8217; The proposition of the writer to &#8216;abstain entirely from animal food,&#8217; on the
score of humanity, he considers &#8216;especially ridiculous.&#8217; He has &#8216;the gravest authority for
stating, that every drop of water that quenches our thirst or laves our bodies, contains innumerable
insects, which are sacrificed to our necessities or comforts; each ingredient in
the simplest vegetable fare conveys to inevitable destruction thousands of the most beautiful
and harmless of created beings. From the first to the last gasp of our lives, we never
inhale the air of heaven without butchering myriads of sentient and innocent creatures.
Can we upbraid ourselves then for supporting our lives by the death of a few animals, many
of whom are themselves carnivorous, when the infant who has lived for a single day has
killed an infinitely greater number of human beings than the longest life would suffice to
murder by design? Or, if we sacrifice either our lives or our comforts by scrupulously
denying ourselves the use of animal food, can we derive much consolation from considering
that we spare a few scores of beings, when we involuntarily, but knowingly, are
every moment massacreing more than the longest life-time would suffice to enumerate?&#8217;
<span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">A reference</span> to the case of &#8216;<em>Rachael Baker, the American Somnambulist</em>,&#8217;
in a late London Magazine, has recalled that remarkable phenomenon very forcibly
to our mind. <span class="special_name">Rachael Baker</span> resided within four miles of &#8216;the house where we were
born;&#8217; and the first exhibitions of her religious exercises during sleep took place alternately
at the homestead and the residence of a relation in its near vicinity. We remember
as it were but yesterday the solemnity which sat upon the faces of the assembled neighbors,
as they awaited the signal-groan from an adjoining apartment, to which, at about
seven <span class="small_all_caps">P.&nbsp;M.</span>, the Somnambulist usually retired for the night. When the door was opened
the crowd pressed in. The sleeper, dressed in white muslin, lay straight and motionless in
bed; her eyes closed, her face white and inflexible as marble; and her fingers with livid
marks beneath the nails, clasped meekly upon her bosom. Flecks of foam were visible
at the corners of her mouth, and her lips moved &#8216;as if they would address themselves to
speech,&#8217; for some seconds before any audible sound came from them. At length, however,
in a clear silvery voice she opened with prayer; a prayer fervent, devotional, and evidently
direct from the heart. When this was concluded, and after the lapse of a brief space,
she began an exhortation, in language pure, beautiful, often eloquent, and occasionally
rising to a noble sublimity; and then closed with prayer. If interrupted with a question,
as she frequently was, by clergymen, medical gentlemen, and others, she answered it with
readiness, and with a felicity of language surpassing belief.  &#8216;<span class="special_name">Rachael</span>,&#8217; said a clergyman
to her in our hearing one evening, while in the midst of her discourse, &#8216;why do you engage
in these exercises? and why&#8212;&#8212;&#8217; She interrupted the speaker with words to this effect:
&#8216;I, even I, a worm of the dust, am but a feeble instrument in the hands of <span class="special_name">Him</span> who hath
declared, &#8216;I will pour out of my spirit upon you; and your sons and your daughters shall
prophesy; your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams. And
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page85" name="page85"></a>85</span>on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my spirit, and they
shall prophesy.&#8217; Even <em>so</em> <span class="special_name">Father</span>, for so it seemeth good in thy sight!&#8217; The girl was of
bashful demeanor; altogether uneducated; could scarcely read; knew little of the Bible;
and indeed in her waking hours conversed in a language that was far from being respectable
English; but neither in her prayers nor in her exhortations was she ever at fault; nor
did she at any time exhibit the slightest hesitation or confusion. Her answers to questions
were brief, pointed, and invariably correct. Crowds flocked to see her, until the public
curiosity overran all bounds. She was visited by many persons from New-York; and
finally, under the direction of a committee of medical gentlemen from the city, was brought
to the metropolis, where she created a great sensation. A pamphlet was written upon her
case by Dr. <span class="special_name">Mitchell</span>; and we should feel greatly obliged to any reader who would place
it for a short time in our hands. <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">A valued</span> friend and correspondent, to whose
kindness we have frequently been indebted, has sent us a &#8216;<i>Massachusetts Centinel</i>,&#8217; printed

is a copy of an original letter written by the celebrated <span class="special_name">George Alexander Stevens</span>,
author of &#8216;Lecture on Heads,&#8217; etc., dated at &#8216;Yarmouth Jail, County of Norfolk,&#8217; which

<div class="quotation">
<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">Sir</span>: When I parted from you at Doncaster, I imagined, long before this, to have met with some
oddities worth acquainting you with. It is grown a fashion of late to write lives; I have now, and
for a long time have had, leisure enough to undertake mine, but want materials for the latter part of it;
for my existence now cannot properly be called living, but what the painters term <em>still life</em>; having
ever since February 13, been confined in this town-goal for a London debt.</p>

<p>&#8216;As a hunted deer is always shunned by the happier herd, so am I deserted by the company,<a href="#fn7" class="fnmarker" id="fnm7" title="The Norwich company of players, to which he belonged.">7</a> my
share taken off, and no support left me, save what my wife can spare me out of hers:</p>

<p>&#8216;Deserted in my utmost need</p>
<p>By those my former bounty fed.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;With an economy, which until now I was a stranger to, I have made shift to victual hitherto my little
garrison, but then it has been with the aid of my good friends and allies&#8212;my clothes. This week&#8217;s
eating finishes my last waistcoat; and next, I must atone for my errors upon bread and water.</p>

<p>&#8216;<span class="special_name">Themistocles</span> had so many towns to furnish his table, and a whole city bore the charge of his
meals. In some respects I am like him, for I am furnished by the labors of a multitude. A wig has
fed me two days; the trimming of a waistcoat as long; a pair of velvet breeches paid my washerwoman,
and a ruffled shirt has found me in shaving. My coats I swallowed by degrees. The sleeves I
breakfasted upon for weeks; the body, skirts, etc., served me for dinner two months. My silk stocking
have paid my lodgings, and two pair of new pumps enabled me to smoke several pipes. It is incredible
how my appetite, (barometer like) rises in proportion as my necessities make their terrible
advances. I here could say something droll about a good stomach, but it is ill jesting with edge tools,
and I am sure that is the sharpest thing about me. You may think I can have no sense of my condition,
that while I am thus wretched, I should offer at ridicule: but, Sir, people constituted like me,
with a disproportioned levity of spirits, are always most merry when they are most miserable; and
quicken like the eyes of the consumptive, which are always brightest the nearer the patient approaches
his dissolution. However, Sir, to show you I am not lost to all reflection, I think myself
poor enough to want a favor, and humble enough to ask it here. Sir, I might make an encomium on
your good nature, humanity, etc.; but I shall not pay so bad a compliment to your understanding, as
to endeavor, by a parade of phrases, to win it over to my interest. If you could, any night at a concert,
make a small collection for me, it might be a means of my obtaining my liberty; and you well
know, Sir, the first people of rank abroad will perform the most friendly offices for the sick; be not,
therefore, offended at the request of a poor (though a deservedly punished) debtor.</p>

<div class="gossip_section">
<p><span class="first_word">Among</span> the facetiÃ¦ of the &#8216;Centinel&#8217; we find a clever hit at two prominent official characters
of the name of <span class="special_name">Day</span>: &#8216;<span class="special_name">Titus</span>, a Roman emperor, we are told, once lamented that &#8216;<em>he
had lost a Day</em>.&#8217; If the commonwealth of Massachusetts were to <em>lose two Days</em>, it would
not be the cause of much lamentation!&#8217; A correspondent elsewhere observes, that in a procession
on a certain solemn occasion in this city, the place of the physician was immediately
before the corpse; which, he adds, was &#8216;exactly consonant with the etiquette observed at
capital executions in ancient times; the <em>executioner</em> always going before!&#8217; By the way,
&#8216;speaking of <span class="special_name">Stevens</span>;&#8217; perhaps the reader of good things at second-hand may not be
aware how much he is indebted to this author&#8217;s &#8216;<i>Lectures on Heads</i>&#8217; for amusement and instruction.
They were very popular throughout Great Britain; and as illustrated by the
author, after the manner of &#8216;<span class="special_name">Old Matthews</span>,&#8217; they are said to have been irresistible. It
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page86" name="page86"></a>86</span>was in this collection that the law-cases of &#8216;<span class="special_name">Bullum</span> <i>vs.</i> <span class="special_name">Boatum</span>&#8217; and &#8216;<span class="special_name">Daniel</span> <i>vs.</i> <span class="special_name">Dishclout</span>&#8217;
had their origin. They are familiar to every school-boy, not less for their wit than
the canine Latinity in which they abound; &#8216;<i>Primus strokus est provokus</i>; now who gave
the <i>primus strokus</i>? Who gave the first offence?&#8217; Or, &#8216;a drunken man is &#8216;<i>homo duplicans</i>,&#8217;
or a double man, seeing things double,&#8217; etc., etc. We annex an example or two of the writer&#8217;s
<em>individuality</em>. The first is a sketch of a <i>nil admirari</i> critic and amateur, who has travelled
long enough abroad to fall in love with every thing foreign, and despise every thing belonging
to his own country except himself: &#8216;He pretended to be a great judge of paintings, but only
admired those done a great way off, and a great while ago; he could not bear any thing
painted by any of his own countrymen. One day being in an auction-room where there was
a number of capital pictures, and among the rest an inimitable painting of fruits and flowers,
the connoisseur would not give his opinion of the picture until he had examined his catalogue;
when, finding it was done by one of his own countrymen, he pulled out his eye-glass,
exclaiming: &#8216;This fellow has spoiled a fine piece of canvass; he&#8217;s worse than a sign-post
dauber; there&#8217;s no keeping, no perspective, no fore-ground, no <i>chiar&#8217;oscuro</i>. Look you, he
has attempted to paint <em>a fly</em> upon that rose-bud! Why, it is no more like a fly than I am
like an &#8212;&#8212;&#8217; But as the connoisseur approached his finger to the picture, the fly flew away.
It happened to be the <em>real</em> insect!&#8217; Is not the following a forcible picture of a mercurial,
hero-loving Frenchman? &#8216;Has he property? An edict from the <i>Grand Monarque</i> can take
it, and he is satisfied. Pursue him to the Bastile, or the dismal dungeon in the country to
which a lettre-de-cachet conveys him, and buries him for life: there see him in all his
misery; ask him &#8216;What is the cause?&#8217; &#8216;<i>Je ne sai pas</i>; it is the will of the <i>Grand Monarque</i>.&#8217;
Give him a <i>soup-maigre</i>, a little sallad, and a hind-quarter of a frog, and he&#8217;s in
spirits. &#8216;Fal, lal, lal! <i>Vive le Roi?</i> <i>Vive la bagatelle!&#8217;</i>&#8217; Here we have a Materialist
proving the affinity of matter: &#8216;All round things are globular, all square things flat-sided.
Now, if the bottom is equal to the top, and the top equal to the bottom, and the bottom and
top are equal to the four sides, then all matter is as broad as it is long.&#8217; But the materialist
&#8216;had not in his head matter sufficient to prove matter efficient; and being thus deficient,
he knew nothing of the matter.&#8217; One of <span class="special_name">Stevens&#8217;s</span> &#8216;heads&#8217; was that of a heartless, devil-may-care
sort of person, in some respects like the hero of &#8216;<i>A Capital Joke</i>&#8217; in preceding
pages, who is always &#8216;keeping it up.&#8217; He illustrates his own character very forcibly: &#8216;I&#8217;ll
tell you how it was; you see, I was in high spirits, so I stole a dog from a blind man, for I
do <em>so</em> love fun! So then the blind man cried for his dog, and that made me laugh; so says
I to the blind man. &#8216;Halloo, master! do you want your dog?&#8217; &#8216;Yes, Sir, indeed, <em>indeed</em> I
do,&#8217; says he. Then says I to the blind man, says I, &#8216;Go look for him! Keep it up!&#8217; I
always turn sick when I think of a parson; and my brother, he&#8217;s a parson too, and he hates
to hear any body swear; so I always swear when I am along with him, just to roast him.
I went to dine with him one day last week; and as soon as I arrived, I began to swear. I
never swore so well in all my life; I swore all my new oaths. At last my brother laid
down his knife and fork, and lifting up his hands and eyes, he calls out: &#8216;<em>O Tempora!
O Mores</em>.&#8217; &#8216;Oh, ho! brother,&#8217; says I, &#8216;don&#8217;t think to frighten me by calling all your
family about you. I don&#8217;t mind you nor your family neither. Only bring Tempora and
Moses <em>here</em>&#8212;that&#8217;s all! I&#8217;ll box &#8217;em for five pounds. Keep it up!&#8217; <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="special_name">There</span> is many

<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">Who</span> hath redness of eyes?&#8217; This interrogative &#8216;portion of divine scripture&#8217; is forcibly
illustrated by an anecdote, related with most effective dryness by a friend of ours. An
elderly gentleman, accustomed to &#8216;indulge,&#8217; entered the bar-room of an inn in the pleasant
city of H&#8212;&#8212;, on the Hudson, where sat a grave Friend toasting his toes by the fire.
Lifting a pair of green spectacles upon his forehead, rubbing his inflamed eyes, and calling
for a hot brandy-toddy, he seated himself by the grate; and as he did so, he remarked to
Uncle <span class="special_name">Broadbrim</span> that &#8216;his eyes were getting weaker and weaker, and that even spectacles
didn&#8217;t seem to do &#8216;em any good.&#8217; &#8216;I&#8217;ll tell thee friend,&#8217; rejoined the Quaker, &#8216;what
I think. I think if thee was to <em>wear thy spectacles over thy mouth</em> for a few months, thy
eyes would get sound again!&#8217; The &#8216;complainant&#8217; did not even return thanks for this
medical counsel, but sipped his toddy in silence, and soon after left the room, &#8216;uttering
never a word.&#8217; <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">There</span> have been various surmises, and sundry contradictory
statements, in relation to the work superscribed &#8216;<i>Count D&#8217;Orsay on Etiquette</i>,&#8217; which
we noticed at some length in our December issue. Mr. <span class="special_name">Willis</span>, of the &#8216;New Mirror&#8217;
weekly journal, seems to question its having been <em>written</em> by the <span class="special_name">Count</span>, but expresses his
belief that he may have loaned his name to the publishers &#8216;for a consideration;&#8217; and
this may possibly have been the fact with the latest London edition. The author of the
work in question, however, is Mr. <span class="special_name">Charles William Day</span>, an English gentleman,
whose acquaintance with the usages of the best European society is personal and authentic;
who has observed and travelled much; and who is moreover an artist of a
high order; painting in miniature, and sketching with admirable skill. An esteemed
friend and correspondent of this Magazine writes us from Boston, that the manner of the
fraud is somewhat as follows: &#8216;Mr. <span class="special_name">Day</span> is the author of a Journal of Travels, which
Messrs. <span class="special_name">Longman and Company</span> of London proposed to publish. As they treated him,
however, in a dishonorable manner, he withdrew his <span class="small_all_caps">MSS.</span> from them and came to America.
In retaliation, they sent orders to this country to have a spurious edition published of his
work on &#8216;Etiquette,&#8217; which they had formerly brought out, and which they truly supposed
he designed to reprint in New-York or Boston. It has passed through more than twenty
editions in London; a fact which I know, from having seen the Messrs. <span class="special_name">Longmans&#8217;</span> letters
and accounts with the author. His own edition is now in press in Boston; and I learn that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page88" name="page88"></a>88</span>he has added some &#8216;Hints&#8217; with an especial eye to Yankee manners.&#8217; We have also received
a letter from Mr. <span class="special_name">Day</span> himself, in which, while he &#8216;forbears at present to make any
comments on the conduct of the Messrs. <span class="special_name">Longman</span>,&#8217; he proves beyond a doubt that &#8216;the
Count <span class="special_name">D&#8217;Orsay</span> is <em>not</em> the writer of the &#8216;Hints on Etiquette,&#8217; but that he himself is &#8216;the
real, true author,&#8217; past all peradventure. <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">A friend</span> lately returned from the west,
relates among other matters the following anecdote: &#8216;On board of one of the steam-boats
on the Mississippi, I encountered a deck-hand, who went by the name of <span class="special_name">Barney</span>. Like
many of his class, he was a drinking, reckless fellow, but warm-hearted, good-natured, and
generous to a fault. In early life he was in easy circumstances; was a husband, and the
father of several children. But one night during a violent storm the house in which he
resided was struck by lightning, and the whole family, save himself, were instantly killed.
His own escape was considered a miracle at the time, not even a hair of his head having been
singed. From that time, however, he took to drinking, and so sank lower and lower until
he became what I found him. When I had heard his story, I felt somewhat interested in
the man, and one day managed to draw him into conversation. He told me his early history
with much natural pathos; and finding him in the &#8216;melting mood&#8217; I endeavored to
lead him to some serious thoughts upon the subject of his misfortunes, and especially of that
one which had bereft him in so awful a manner of his wife and children. &#8216;<span class="special_name">Barney</span>,&#8217; said
I, &#8216;don&#8217;t you think it was a signal mercy that you alone should have escaped unharmed
from the bolt which destroyed all else you loved upon earth? Was there not at least
something <em>singular</em> in the fact?&#8217; &#8216;That&#8217;s what I said myself,&#8217; replied <span class="special_name">Barney</span>, in a tremulous
voice; &#8216;I always thought it was <em>very</em> sing&#8217;lar. But the fact I suppose was this, Mr.
<span class="special_name">Whitehat</span>. The lightning, you see, was afraid of <em>a man</em>, and so like a d&#8212;&#8212;d sneak, it went

<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">We</span> should indeed be sorry if our demeanor in those vast crowds, where English people flock together,
rather, as it would seem, to assert a right, than to gratify an inclination, were to be taken as an
index of our national character: the want of all ease and simplicity, those essential ingredients of
agreeable society, which distinguish these dreary meetings have long been unfortunately notorious.
Too busy to watch the feelings of others, and too earnest to moderate our own, that true politeness
which pays respect to age; which tries to put the most insignificant person in company on a level
with the most considerable&#8212;virtues which our neighbors possess in an eminent degree&#8212;are, except
in a few favored instances, unknown among us; while affectation, in other countries the badge of ignorance
and vulgarity, is ours, even in its worst shape, when it borrows the mien of rudeness, impertinence,
and effrontery, the appendage of those whose station is most conspicuous, and whose dignity
is best ascertained. There is more good breeding in the cottage of a French peasant than in all the
boudoirs of Grosvenor square. <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> &#8216;Frivolity and insipidity are the prevailing characteristics of
conversation; and nowhere in Europe, perhaps, does difference of fortune or of station produce more
unsocial or illiberal separation. Very few of those whom fortune has released from the necessity of
following some laborious profession are capable of passing their time agreeably without the assistance
of company; not from the spirit of gaity which calls upon society for indulgence; not from any
pleasure they take in conversation, where they are frequently languid and taciturn; but to rival each
other in the luxury of the table, or by a great variety of indescribable airs, to make others feel the
pain of mortification. They meet as if to fight the boundaries of their rank and fashion, and the less
definite and perceptible is the line which divides them, the more punctilious is their pride. It is a
great mistake to suppose that this low-minded folly is peculiar to people of rank; it is <em>an English
disease</em>.&#8217;</p>

<p>No doubt of it; and the question naturally arises, &#8216;Are not these the proper people to
talk about men and manners and society in America?&#8217; <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> &#8216;<span class="first_word">Never</span> mind, my dear,&#8217; says
Baron <span class="special_name">Pompolino</span>, while endeavoring to fit the fairy slipper of the lovely <span class="special_name">Cinderella</span>
upon the long splay foot of one of his ungainly daughters, &#8216;never mind, my dear, <em>she is not at
all like you</em>!&#8217; The doting father, it will be remembered, gives this verdict as a flattering
compliment. We have sometimes been amused, where the <i>quo animo</i> was apparent, with
similar compliments at the hands of reciprocal critics of literature. Pleasant examples in
this kind have been furnished lately. A very voluminous critic, very far &#8216;down east,&#8217; spoke
recently in a metropolitan journal of <span class="special_name">Goldsmith</span>&#8217;s  &#8216;<i>Deserted Village</i>&#8217; as &#8216;a very common-place
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page89" name="page89"></a>89</span>poem, at the best, and only saved from utter and most contemptuous forgetfulness by
two or three pleasantries about &#8216;broken tea-cups,&#8217; etc., and by one single passage that
smacks of sublimity!&#8217; Of the poetry however of the author of &#8216;<i>Man in his Various Aspects
under the American Republic</i>,&#8217; he expresses in the same columns quite a different
opinion. &#8216;There has been,&#8217; he writes, &#8216;no English poetry better than his, within the memory
of man!&#8217; A writer in the last number of the &#8216;<i>Southern Literary Messenger</i>,&#8217; likewise
voluminous in prose and verse, if we rightly surmise, exhibits contrasts of judgment somewhat
kindred with the foregoing, although certainly less violent. The author of &#8216;Man in
his various Aspects,&#8217; he tells us, &#8216;has a <em>boldness</em> that attracts;&#8217; his are the &#8216;strong and
struggling conceptions which seek utterance in new and original forms.&#8217; He dares &#8216;to
shun the beaten paths,&#8217; and is not afraid to be obscure. His is not the poetry &#8216;which takes
the popular ear without tasking the popular thought,&#8217; like &#8216;the simple common-places of
<span class="special_name">Longfellow</span>.&#8217; Such &#8216;criticism&#8217; as this we have cited must needs &#8216;make the judicious&#8217;
laugh merely, being too impotent to make them &#8216;grieve.&#8217; It is not perhaps assuming
too much to suppose, that <span class="special_name">Goldsmith</span>&#8217;s &#8216;Deserted Village&#8217; and <span class="special_name">Longfellow</span>&#8217;s &#8216;Psalms
of Life,&#8217; <em>simple</em> though they be, will live and be cherished in generations of human hearts,
when the volumes of our critics and their client that yet survive the recollection of any
save their publishers, shall be &#8216;forgotten and clean out of mind.&#8217; <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span>It is related of the
celebrated clergyman, <span class="special_name">John Mason</span>, that sitting at a steam-boat table on one occasion, just
as the passengers were &#8216;falling to&#8217; in the customary manner, he suddenly rapped vehemently
upon the board with the end of his knife, and exclaimed: &#8216;Captain! is this boat out of
the jurisdiction of <span class="special_name">God Almighty</span>? If not, let us at least thank <span class="special_name">Him</span> for his continued
goodness;&#8217; and he proceeded to pronounce &#8216;grace&#8217; amidst the most reverent stillness. It is
to be hoped, however, that his &#8216;grace&#8217; was not like the few set words handed down from
father to son, mumbled without emotion, and despatched with indecent haste, which one
sometimes hears repeated over country repasts. &#8216;Bless this portion of food now in readiness
for us; give it to us in thy love; let us eat and drink in thy fear&#8212;for <span class="special_name">Christ</span>&#8217;s
sake&#8212;&#8212;<span class="special_name">Lorenzo</span>, <em>take your fingers out of that plate!</em>&#8217; was a grace once said in <em>our</em>
hearing, but evidently not in that of the spoilt boy, &#8216;growing and always hungry,&#8217; who
could not wait to be served. We should prefer to such insensible flippancy the practice
of an old divine in New-England, who in asking a blessing upon his meals, was wont to
name each separate dish. Sitting down one day to a dinner, which consisted partly of
clams, bear-steak, etc., he was forced in a measure to forego his usual custom of furnishing
a &#8216;bill of particulars.&#8217; &#8216;Bless to our use,&#8217; said he, &#8216;these treasures hid in the sand;
bless this&#8212;&#8212;&#8217; But the bear&#8217;s-meat puzzled him, and he concluded with: &#8216;Oh! <span class="special_name">Lord</span>,
<em>thou only knowest what it is</em>!&#8217; <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">A favorite</span> correspondent of this Magazine, who appears
in the pages of the present number for the first time in several months, accompanies
his excellent paper with a letter, from which we take these sentences: &#8216;Since you last
heard from me, I have experienced a severe domestic affliction in the loss of my father,
who died during the last summer. Day after day and night after night for two months I
sat by his bed-side, hoping in vain for his recovery, until life&#8217;s star was extinguished in the
darkness of the grave.&#8217; Our cordial sympathies are with our correspondent; but sympathy
for affliction such as his can carry with it little of consolation to the bereaved:</p>

<p>Perchance our friend may now think with <span class="special_name">Cowper</span>, that &#8216;although he loved, yet not
<em>enough</em>, the gentle hand that reared him.&#8217; &#8216;The chief thing that I have to reproach myself
with,&#8217; writes one who laments a kindred dispensation of the <span class="special_name">Supreme</span>, &#8216;is a sort of inattention
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page90" name="page90"></a>90</span>to my father&#8217;s feelings, occasionally, arising merely from the disparity of years between
us, which I am sensible must at times have interfered with his enjoyments. I would
gladly recall now, if I could, many opportunities I suffered to pass, of being more in his company,
and more in the way of his advice and instruction.&#8217; But he adds: &#8216;When I reflect on
these things, it appears to me one of the strongest natural arguments for the immortality of
the soul, and the renewal of our earthly relations in a world to come, that even where the
greatest possible attachment subsists between parents and their children, the mere disparity
of years inevitably prevents that complete association of feelings, and intimate fellowship of
heart and soul, which is the cement and prerogative of all other friendships: in a world to
come, but no where else, such attachments must receive their full completion.&#8217; <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="special_name">Professor
Gouraud</span>, well known among us for his devotion to the interests of art and science,
has perfected a <i>System of Remembrance</i>, which he designates by the term &#8216;<i>Mnemotechny</i>,&#8217;
and which we venture to predict will prove of the greatest service to nearly every class of
society. No system of modern mnemonics bears any resemblance to, or comparison with it.
Such is the astonishing effect of the plan, that young masters and misses, after a brief study of
it, can with ease answer <em>any</em> question from score after score of close-printed pages, involving
every variety of events, and all kinds of information. We &#8216;speak but the things which we do

the community, we forbear farther comment at this time upon the useful art which he has

Edinburgh Review upon &#8216;<i>Theatres and the Drama</i>,&#8217; which is replete with wisdom, and
evinces a thorough mastery of the theme. In alluding to the appeals which are now made
to the eye by elaborate scenery, machinery, etc., less than to the mind and imagination by
superior intellectual personation, the reviewer in effect remarks, that the first attempt at positive
reality is fatal to pleasurable illusion. Every person in the pit is aware that the
stage <em>is a stage</em>, &#8216;and all the men and women merely players.&#8217; In &#8216;As you Like It,&#8217; at
Drury-Lane, an attempt was made to imitate the notes of birds. &#8216;Suppose the imitation
had been so close as to deceive the audience into the belief that there were birds there singing;
would not the contrast with trees of painted canvass have been revolting? These
were not the conceptions of <span class="special_name">Shakspeare</span>, when he made his chorus say:</p>

</div>
<p>Advice as necessary at the present day as then; for we may enlarge our stages, increase our
supernumeraries, and engage &#8216;real horses;&#8217; but we can never make any one believe the
stage is other than the stage. The audience can realize for themselves. This trust in
the all-sufficiency of imagination is precisely that acted on by children in their daily sports,
where from the boundless wealth of the imagination, the rudest materials supply the place
of the costliest. Whoever watches boys &#8216;playing horse,&#8217; making a pocket-handkerchief
dangling behind to represent the tail, and sees them stamping, snorting, prancing, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page91" name="page91"></a>91</span>champing the imaginary bit, witnesses the alchymy of the imagination, an alchymy out-stripping
all the wonders and out-weighing all the treasures of the prosaic positive chemistry,
so longed for by the present generation. The child &#8216;supposes&#8217; the handkerchief a tail, and
it becomes a tail. He has but to say to his companion: &#8216;This shall be a whip and this shall
be the harness,&#8217; and the things are there; not as matters of literal fact, but of imaginative
truth. He plays for the enjoyment of the game and the exercise of his imagination; and
therefore the handkerchief serves every purpose. This is the procedure of nature. But the
modern parent, anxious to realize for the child, and to instil a love of accuracy into his
mind, gives him a superb horse-hair tail, bidding him at the same time be careful not to spoil
it. What is the result? The child&#8217;s attention is called from the game, to the consideration
of or delight in the tail, which, originally meant as a collateral aid, now takes the first place.
The boy no doubt is delighted with his horse-hair tail; but (if it be not altogether superfluous,)
it will soon destroy his game, so that the exercise, both of frame and imagination,
is lost; the end becomes subordinate to the means. This is precisely what takes place with
the drama. Observe also one important point: The tail is <em>real</em>; accuracy is attempted:
but though the tail be real, the horse is not; the horse is played by a boy, and only by a boy; it
is in this mimicry that the enjoyment consists. But how absurd to put a real tail on an unreal
horse! How revolting this mixture of imagination and fact! It is equalled only by that ludicrous
practice of placing the face of a <em>real</em> watch in the place of a church-clock in a landscape;
where one may not only see the time of day, but may also hear it <em>struck</em>, and that
amidst painted trees and houses! This effect, except to the most literal and prosaic minds, is
revolting and discordant. But this the modern drama is strenuously endeavoring to produce.
&#8216;In opera, ballet, and spectacle, scenery and illustrations must be effective, because they
form elements of the piece. In the drama, where the source of entertainment is intellectual,
they are merely accessories, and should be used in such wise as to keep up the harmony of
effect, but never so as to distract attention from the drama to themselves.&#8217; Here is a passage
which is not less applicable in America than in England: &#8216;A few years ago it was not uncommon
to see several performers of rival excellence supported by others of ability, all
playing in the same piece. It is now a rare thing for rivals to play together. A single good
actor, among a dozen bad, is deemed sufficient. Are we then to wonder that the regular
drama does not pay?&#8217; <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="special_name">Our</span> readers will remember the order given by the Chinese
Emperor to a corps of Mandarins, who were to exterminate the &#8216;barbarian Englishers&#8217; in
the harbor of Canton, by going down to the bank of the river in the night, and then and
there &#8216;dive straight on board those foreign ships, and put every soul of them to death!&#8217;
Subsequently however the red-bristling foreigners managed to land, when, as it since turns
out, it became necessary to adopt more sanguinary measures. The Emperor called up one
of his &#8216;great generals,&#8217; and gave him his dreadful orders: &#8216;You must dress your soldiers,&#8217;
said he, &#8216;in a very frightful manner, painting their faces with the most horrid figures, and
depicting dragons and monsters on your banners: you must then rush upon the barbarians
with fearful outcries, and terrify them so that they will fall down flat on their faces; and
when they are once down,&#8217; said the Imperial potentate, &#8216;<em>their breeches are so tight that they
can never get up again</em>!&#8217; <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> &#8216;<span class="special_name">I give</span> you five minutes every day to look at the stars, but
don&#8217;t particularize; for some in those far-off places send down their light long after they
have been knocked out of existence, and you may be looking at a blank.&#8217; So wrote &#8216;<span class="special_name">Julian</span>&#8217;
in this department of our last number. Prof. <span class="special_name">Olmstead</span>, of Yale-College, in a recent lecture
before the &#8216;Mercantile Library Association,&#8217; described the difficulty of ascertaining the
distance of the stars from each other and from our earth; yet, he remarked, it had been done.
The nearest star&#8217;s distance from us had been measured, and by the aid of light, by which it
could alone be accomplished. That distance, he said, was immense, requiring ten years
for light to traverse it! The planets, he had no doubt, were inhabited. Of what use was
the reflection of the sun&#8217;s rays upon them, if there were no eyes there to behold it? What
was the use of moons, which the planets certainly have? He spoke also of the fixed stars,
which seem by the aid of a telescope to be innumerable. What was their purpose?&#8212;for a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page92" name="page92"></a>92</span>guide to mariners? No; for a very small portion of them could be seen by the unassisted
eye. They were suns like our suns, to worlds like our worlds! To the inhabitants of those
fixed stars our sun appears as a star, and the planetary system revolving around it, of
which the earth is one, are unseen by them, as are those of theirs by us! Great <span class="special_name">God</span>!
&#8216;When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou
hast ordained; what is <em>man</em>, that thou art mindful of him, and the son of man, that thou

us of the pleasant satire of &#8216;<em>Thinks-I-to-myself</em>&#8217; upon this theme: &#8216;We lived, you must
know,&#8217; he writes, &#8216;in a <em>Hall</em>; not when I was born, however, nor till long afterward. My
sister happened to have a correspondent at school near London, who finding it essentially
necessary to the support of her dignity among her school-fellows, always directed her letters
so; for the parents of one she found, lived at something <span class="special_name">House</span>; and of another at What&#8217;s-its-name
<span class="special_name">Place</span>; and of another at Thingummy <em>Lodge</em>; of another at the <em>Grange</em>; of
another at the <em>Castle</em>; of another at the <em>Park</em>; Miss <span class="special_name">Blaze</span>, the daughter of a retired

unequivocally bespoke a low origin!&#8217; Is this folly altogether indigenous to England? Let
the high-sounding names of scores of painted pine palaces not a thousand miles from this

result, but was at the same time unwilling to relinquish his pride of opinion, by the note
of our Mississippi correspondent, to whose long communication we alluded in our last
number. We <em>have</em> &#8216;taken its measure,&#8217; as we promised, and find it quite beyond our
compass. <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="special_name">Our</span> friend the <em>Poetical Englishman</em> is somewhat severe upon the godly
inhabitants of &#8216;<span class="special_name">Botolph&#8217;s Town</span>;&#8217; yet we see nothing in his epistle that is not justified
by recent occurrences in the &#8216;Literary Emporium.&#8217; It is lamentable that Boston should be
robbed of a decent theatre by an epidemic of pseudo-sanctity. <span class="special_name">Macready</span> was compelled
to play a recent engagement at a second-rate house, down in the &#8216;Wapping&#8217; end of the
town, whither all the beauty and fashion crowded nightly through the mud to see him. It
strikes us that the &#8216;<i>Purification Hymn</i>,&#8217; alluded to by our correspondent, must have been
a choice production of some <span class="special_name">Mawworm</span> of the day. Its reasoning is highly pellucid, and
its dignity is past all question. &#8216;Mimic scenes, and mirth and joy,&#8217; it would seem, &#8216;allure
souls&#8217; to endless perdition! Now against the licentiousness and drunkenness of the theatre
too much cannot be said; but for &#8216;mimic scenes&#8217; dragging men to &#8212;&#8212;. But <i>cui bono</i>?
&#8216;Your dull ass will never mend his pace with beating.&#8217; By the by, we are well pleased to
see our English friend&#8217;s preference for mind over matter, in the way of <em>dramatic</em> personations.
Yet England has little reason to boast. What says &#8216;the <span class="special_name">Viscount</span>&#8217; to the Chevalier

Lady Macbeth, and all the rest of &#8217;em, whatever their names are, might as well have
no legs at all, for any thing the audience know about it. I&#8217;ll tell you what it is; what the
people call dramatic poetry is a collection of sermons. Do I go to the theatre to be lectured?
No; if I wanted that, I&#8217;d go to church. What&#8217;s the legitimate drama, <span class="special_name">Pip</span>? Human
nature. What are legs? Human nature. Then let us have plenty of leg-pieces,

moves it, how quietly, how gracefully, how lovingly, the whole body of it. It is simply
because it is covered with foliage. The same wind rustling through its dry branches in
winter, would scarce bend a bough, or only to break it. But now, softly whispering

<div class="quotation">
<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">There</span> is much in the aspect of Divine Providence at the present time, both toward our own country
and the world, to awaken gratitude and thoughtful joy. An unexampled spectacle is presented in the
current history of the world. It is moving on almost without a ripple. The changes of time are
taking place as noiselessly as the ordinary changes of nature. The decay of old and injurious social
and political systems is going on like the crumbling of ruins in a desert, by the force of inherent tendency
rather than by external violence; and milder and more benignant systems are appearing, not
like those islands sprung by volcanic shocks above the bosom of the deep, but like the beauty of spring,
or the glory of summer, by a natural and imperceptible growth. Within the memory of many yet
living there was a very different state of things. Scarcely a month then passed without a shock, a
press and medley in human affairs that amazed and bewildered men, and kept anxiety on the stretch.
Such was the history of Europe. Every change was a concussion; every fear a storm; every revolution
a convulsion. Not less in motion is society now, but it is like the motion of the spheres, grand
and silent; and that silence is the emblem and the evidence of greatness and power in the present
movement of Providence in human affairs. The once apparently random and divergent lines of that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page94" name="page94"></a>94</span>Providence now seem to be flowing to a common point, and terminating in one great result&#8212;the improvement
and happiness of our race. Abating much of what has been extravagantly vaunted about
the march of mind and the perfectibility of human society, it is still visibly true that the general condition
of the world is improved and improving. Vast accessions have been made to science; knowledge
has been diffused over a wider surface, than was ever before known; ignorance is felt to be a
calamity if not a crime; truths that were formerly contemplated only in the closet of the sage, have
become familiarized in the cottage and the common mind; the rights of men are better defined and
understood; the power of rulers is swayed within juster limits, and is every where abandoning its
old apparatus of racks and halters and dungeons as the means of governing immortal mind, and is
silently conceding to it its alienable prerogative of free thought.&#8217;</p>

the <span class="small_all_caps">SOUL</span> is destined hereafter: &#8216;When the hour is at hand which is to dissolve the mortal
tie, the soul parts without regret with those delights which it received from its sensual gratifications,
and dwells only, dwells with a fond affection, on the partner or pledges of its love;
or on friends from whom it seems to be cut off for ever; and if it looks, as it must look, to
futurity, these are the first objects of its wishes connected with it, and the first ingredients
in its conceptions of celestial felicity. For my own part (and on a subject like this, where
can we so properly appeal as to ourselves?) although my reason dictates to me the hope of a
future happiness, whatever may be the mode of it, yet my heart feels no interest in the prospect
when viewed as a scene of solitary, selfish enjoyment. It recoils with horror at the
thought of losing the remembrance of every past connexion, and even of those whom it
loved most dearly, and of being forgotten by them utterly and for ever. Is this too, it asks,
one of the delusions of life? No; for all its other passions expire before it; but this remains,
like hope, &#8216;nor leaves us when we die.&#8217;&#8217; <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">The</span> &#8216;<i>Anglo-American</i>&#8217; literary

that Mr. <span class="special_name">Punch</span> has just dropped in from England, bringing the latest intelligence from &#8216;the
other side.&#8217; He has lately visited several places on the continent, not so much to see them
as to be enabled to say, like other English travellers, that he <em>had been there</em>. &#8216;Mr. <span class="special_name">Punch</span>,
having arrived at Rouen late at night, left it very early the next morning, much impressed
with the institutions of the city, both civil and architectural, as well as its manners, customs,
and social life, which he is about to embody in a work called &#8216;<i>Six hours and a half at
Rouen</i>,&#8217; to be brought out by a fashionable publisher.&#8217; From the reports of one of the
learned societies, we derive the following important scientific information: &#8216;Mr. <span class="special_name">Sappy</span> read
a paper, proving the impossibility of being able to see into the middle of next week, from
known facts with regard to the equation of time. He stated that, supposing it possible for
a person to ascend in a balloon sufficiently high for his vision to embrace a distance of seven
hundred miles from east to west, he would then only see forty minutes ahead of him; that
is, he would see places where the day was forty minutes in advance of the day in which he
lived. Thus he might be said to see forty minutes into futurity. It has also been proved
that, in sailing round the world in one direction, a day&#8217;s reckoning is gained; so that the
sailor on his return finds himself to be &#8216;a man in advance of his age&#8217; by one day. This one
day, however, is the farthest attainable limit; and it is therefore impossible to see into the
middle of next Week!&#8217; &#8216;Mr. <span class="special_name">Tite</span>, proprietor of the &#8216;Metropolitan Bakedtatery&#8217; brought forward
his new &#8216;Low Pressure Potatoe-Can,&#8217; upon an improved principle. It was constructed
of tin, and warranted to sustain a pressure of twenty potatoes upon the square bottom. Mr.
<span class="special_name">Tite</span> explained that the steam had nothing to do with the warmth of the fruit, but was quite
independent of it.&#8217; &#8216;Mr. <span class="special_name">Flit</span> brought forward his new and improved Street Telescope for
looking at the moon. It was most ingeniously constructed, being to the eye a fine instrument
of six feet long. Mr. <span class="special_name">Flit</span> explained, however, that the telescope itself was only an
eighteen-inch one, the case being manufactured to increase its importance, in which the
real glass was enclosed. The chief merit of this invention was, that the moon could be
seen equally well on cloudy nights, or when there was none at all, the case enclosing an
ingenious transparency of that body, behind which a small lamp was hung. Mr. <span class="special_name">Flit</span>
could always command a view of any of the celestial bodies by the same means.&#8217; Here
are a few items of law from &#8216;<i>The Comic Blackstone</i>:&#8217; &#8216;The statute of <span class="special_name">Edward</span> the Fourth,
prohibiting any but lords from wearing pikes on their shoes of more than two inches long,
was considered to savor of oppression; but those who were in the habit of receiving
from a lord more kicks than coppers, would consider that the law savored of benevolence.&#8217;
&#8216;Unlawfully detaining a man in any way is imprisonment; so that if you take your neighbor
by the button, and cause him to listen to a long story, you are guilty of imprisonment.&#8217;
<span class="special_name">Punch&#8217;s</span> idea of &#8216;<em>Woman&#8217;s Mission</em>&#8217; differs somewhat from other reformers of the times:
&#8216;To replace the shirt-button of the father, the brother, the husband, which has come off in
putting on the vestment; to bid the variegated texture of the morning slipper or the waistcoat
grow upon the Berlin wool; to repair the breach that incautious haste in dressing has
created in the coat or the trowsers, which there is no time to send out to be mended; are the
special offices of woman; offices for which her digital mechanism has singularly fitted
her.&#8217; Apropos of &#8216;<em>Missions</em>:&#8217; we perceive that <span class="special_name">Dickens</span> understands this vague verbal
apology for eccentricity or humbugeousness, if we interpret aright his frail and tearful <span class="special_name">Moddle</span>;
&#8216;who talked much about people&#8217;s &#8216;missions,&#8217; upon which he seemed to have some private
information not generally attainable,&#8217; and who, &#8216;being aware that a shepherd&#8217;s mission
was to pipe to his flock, and that a boatswain&#8217;s mission was to pipe all hands, and that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page96" name="page96"></a>96</span>one man&#8217;s mission was to be a paid piper, and another man&#8217;s mission was to pay the piper,
had got it into his head that his own peculiar mission was to pipe his eye, which he did perpetually.&#8217;
<span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">A curious</span> volume has recently appeared in Paris, entitled &#8216;<i>PoÃ©sies Populaires
Latines antÃ©rieures au DouziÃ¨me SiÃ¨cle</i>;&#8217; and as sequels to the work, are certain satires
upon the avarice and corruption of the papal government in the twelfth century, among
which is the following curious parody:</p>
<div class="quotation">

<p>&#8216;<i>Here beginneth the Gospel according to Marks of silver.</i>&#8212;In that time the pope said to the Romans:
When the son of man cometh to the seat of our majesty, say ye first, Friend, what seekest
thou? But if he continue knocking, and give you nothing, cast him out into utter darkness. And it
came to pass that a certain poor clerk came to the court of our lord the pope, and cried out, saying,
Have pity on me at least you, O gate-keepers of the pope, for the hand of poverty hath touched me.
Verily I am needy and poor; therefore, I pray ye, relieve my calamity and my wretchedness. But
they, when they heard him, were very wroth, and said, Friend, thy poverty be with thee to perdition!
get behind me, Sathanas, for thou art not wise in the wisdom of money. Verily, verily I say unto
thee, thou shalt not enter into the joy of thy lord until thou hast given thy last farthing. And the
poor man departed, and sold his cloak and his coat and all that he had, and gave it to the cardinals and
to the gate-keepers; and they said, What is this among so many? And they cast him out before the
doors; and he went out, and wept bitterly, and might not be comforted. Then there came to the
court a certain rich clerk, great and fat and swollen, who in a riot had slain a man. He gave first to
the gate-keeper, secondly to the chamberlain, thirdly to the cardinals; but they thought among
themselves that they should have received more. And when our lord the pope heard that the cardinals
and ministers had received many gifts of the clerk, he became sick unto death. But the rich
man sent him a medicine of gold and silver, and immediately he was cured. Then our lord the pope
called to him the cardinals and ministers, and said to them, Brethren, see that no one seduce you with
empty words; for I give you an example, that as I myself receive, so receive ye.&#8217;</p>

<p>The corruptions of this era are equally well illustrated by a very amusing anecdote of
&#8216;a handsome Italian friar, <i>teres atque rotundus</i>, about thirty, and extremely bold and eloquent;&#8217;
doubtless one of that class so felicitously limned by <span class="special_name">Thomson</span>:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&#8216;A little round, fat, oily man of <span class="special_name">God</span></p>
<p>Was one I chiefly marked among the fry;</p>
<p>He had a roguish twinkle in his eye</p>
<p>And shone all glittering with ungodly dew,</p>
<p>If a tight damsel chanced to trippen by;</p>
<p>Which when observed he shrunk into his mew,</p>
<p>And straight would recollect his piety anew.&#8217;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>One day at a remote confessional of the church he declared an unholy and forbidden
passion to a young and beautiful married lady, whom he had long &#8216;followed with his eyes,&#8217;
and begged permission to visit her at her residence. Struck with surprise at this new
revelation of his character, she evaded reply, being secretly minded to inform her husband,
when she returned home, which she did, word for word. He told his wife to contrive to let
the friar come, alone and in secret, the next evening, which chanced to be that of Saturday,
and the night before the Sunday of Saint Lazarus, on which occasion the friar was to
preach. The appointment was made; the friar came, true to the late hour which had
been designated; was received at the door, and shown into the lady&#8217;s bed-room by a servant,
who informed him that she had desired him to request the good man to retire to rest,
and to say that &#8216;she would be with him straight.&#8217; The friar prepared to comply with the
direction, and was about stepping into bed, when the door opened suddenly, and the lady
entered in great apparent trepidation, exclaiming: &#8216;My husband is knocking at the door!
For heaven&#8217;s sake slip into that chest,&#8217; showing him a double one in the apartment, &#8216;and
lie there until I see what may be done! Meanwhile I will hide your clothes somewhere or
other, as well as I am able. Heaven knows I fear more for your holy person than I do for
my own life!&#8217; The unfortunate wretch, seeing himself reduced to such a pass, did as the
worthy lady desired; while the husband, presently coming in, retired to rest with his wife,
who had first locked the friar safe in the chest. The poor prisoner uttered sundry involuntary
noises in the course of the night, and was in the direst terror at the inquiries which
they awakened on the part of the husband. Daylight at length came, and the church-bells
began to ring for prayers, which greatly annoyed the captive, who was to preach at the
cathedral. The husband having risen, ordered two servants to carry the chest to the church
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page97" name="page97"></a>97</span>and place it in the middle, saying they were ordered to do so by the preacher; and that unlocking
the chest without raising the lid, they should leave it there; all which the fellows
did very neatly. Every body stared, and wondered what all this could mean; some said one
thing and some another. At last the bell having ceased to ring, and no one appearing in
the pulpit, or any other part of the church, a young man rose and said: &#8216;Really, the good
friar makes us wait quite too long; pray let us see what he has ordered to be brought in
this chest.&#8217; Having said this much, he before all the congregation lifted up the lid, and
looking in, beheld the friar in his shirt, pale, almost frightened to death, and certainly appearing
more dead than alive, and as if buried in the chest. Finding himself discovered,
however, he collected his mind as well as he could, and stood upright, to the great astonishment
of all present; and having taken his text from the Sunday of Lazarus, he thus addressed
his congregation: &#8216;My dear brethren: I am not at all astonished at your surprise
in seeing me brought before you in this chest, or rather at my ordering myself to be brought
thus: ye know that this is the way in which our holy church commemorates the wonderful
miracle our <span class="special_name">Lord</span> performed on the person of <span class="special_name">Lazarus</span>, in raising him from the dead who
had been buried four days. I was desirous in your favor to present myself to you as it were
in the form of <span class="special_name">Lazarus</span>, in order that seeing me in this chest, which is no other than an
emblem of the sepulchre wherein he had been buried, you might be moved more effectually
to the consideration of what perishable things we are; and that seeing me stripped of all
worldly decorations, thus in my shirt, you may be convinced of the vanity of the things
of this world, the which, if only duly considered, may tend greatly to the amending of
our lives. Will you believe that since yesterday night I have been a thousand times
dead, and revived as <span class="special_name">Lazarus</span> was; and considering my dreadful situation, remember (as
it were with the memory of a similar penance in your hearts) that we must all die, and
trust to <span class="special_name">Him</span> who can bestow upon us life eternal: but first ye must die to sin, to avarice,
to rapine, to lust, and all those sinful deeds to which our nature prompts us.&#8217; In such language,
and in such manner, did the friar continue his sermon. The husband, astonished
at the extraordinary presence of mind which he displayed, laughed heartily at his success;
and in consideration of the adroitness of the culprit, did not attempt any farther revenge;
&#8216;but,&#8217; it is added, &#8216;he took very good care to shut his door in future against all such double-faced
hypocrites.&#8217; <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">Reader</span>, what are you thinking of at this moment? &#8216;Nothing.&#8217;
Indeed! and so were we, and of how much a clever man once said upon the subject; observe:
&#8216;Philosophers have declared they knew nothing, and it is common for us to talk about doing
nothing; for from ten to twenty we go to school to be taught what from twenty to thirty we
are very apt to forget; from thirty to forty we begin to settle; from forty to fifty, we think
away as fast as we can; from fifty to sixty, we are very careful in our accounts; and from
sixty to seventy, we cast up what all our thinking comes to; and then, what between our
losses and our gains, our enjoyments and our inquietudes, even with the addition of old age,
we can but strike a balance of ciphers.&#8217; Happy are they who amidst the variations of nothing
have nothing to fear; if they have nothing to lose, they have nothing to lament; and if they
have done nothing to be ashamed of, they have every thing to hope for. <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">Sententiousness</span>,
let us inform &#8216;S.&#8217; of Cambridge, and antitheses, do not consist of short sentences
and inversion of words <em>merely</em>; and even the most felicitous examples in each case
often sacrifice the sound to the sense. Here is an instance which is unobjectionable: &#8216;I knew
the old miser well. He amassed a fortune by raising hemp; and if he had had his deserts,
would have died as he lived by it.&#8217; <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">Just</span> as the sheets of this department were

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page98" name="page98"></a>98</span>Aqueducts in the Campagna di Roma,&#8217; and other pictures; altogether, an exceedingly
fine collection. Indeed, the superb view of Ã†tna alone, with its vast and sublime accessories,
is of itself an exhibition worth twice the price of admission. At the rooms of the

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page99" name="page99"></a>99</span>We should exceedingly like to hear Mr. <span class="special_name">A. Bronson Alcott&#8217;s</span> opinion as touching the <em>faithfulness</em>
of the foregoing. <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">There</span> is a fearful lesson conveyed in the annexed communication
from a metropolitan physician, who assures us that it is in all respects an accurate
statement of an occurrence to which he was an eye-witness: &#8216;Duty impels me, Mr.
<span class="special_name">Editor</span>, to lay before you one of the little incidents which my situation as a medical man
has brought to my notice. There is no class of men who are led with keener perceptions
to investigate human nature than enlightened practising physicians. They have a hold
upon the affections and confidence of every class of society; and for this reason they
should feel it incumbent upon themselves to act the part of <em>moral</em> as well as <em>physical</em> agents.
For myself, I think it would be well if medical men were so far constituted missionaries,
as to make it a duty to point a moral whenever it would be likely to be well received. I
am aware that attempts of this sort with many persons would be vain or injudicious, and
sometimes nauseate perhaps, like the accompanying drugs; but eventually it might prove
salutary to the soul; and although cursed for good advice, is it not in the end a blessing?
But to my story: I was called a short time since to a youth about twenty years of age:
he had been only a few months in the city, and I had occasionally seen him, but had little
acquaintance with him, being much his senior. When I entered, one of his fits of raving,
occasioned by fever, was just coming on. I approached and took his hand: &#8216;What do you
want?&#8217; said he; &#8216;you look so mild and yet so penetrating. I have not got any.&#8217; &#8216;Any
<em>what</em>?&#8217; said I. &#8216;Any money,&#8217; he replied; &#8216;the drawer was locked, and I could not get
any without being seen; so go away!&#8217; &#8216;I came to cure you, not to take your money,&#8217; I
replied. &#8216;Ah!&#8217; said he, &#8216;did I not take some from you? Look! look! There they come!
sixpences, shillings!  See! see! how they tumble from the wall! Look! there is a piece
of gold!  See! look! there they keep coming!  I never took all this!&#8212;at first I only took
enough to get a cigar with, now and then. See! the room is filling! I shall suffocate!&#8217;
&#8216;What does this mean, young man?&#8217; said I; &#8216;be calm.&#8217; &#8216;Did they not tell you to <em>come and
feel my pulse and see if there was not a sixpence in it</em>?&#8217; &#8216;No, no; I came to make you better.&#8217;
&#8216;Better? <em>better</em>? <span class="small_all_caps">BETTER</span>? Here, hide these; don&#8217;t let my friends know of them;
they were stolen! I cannot look at them now. Ha! ha! ha!&#8212;I cannot!&#8217; I was induced to
remain until the frenzy of the fever had passed off, and found the young man had intervals
of reason. He was now in deep despondency. I inquired his name. He had dropped it,
he said; he could not debase it. &#8216;Debase it?&#8217; said I.  &#8216;Yes!&#8217; he answered, with a groan
like a howl. The next day the young man sent for me again. He appeared much altered;
said that he did not wish to live; that he had &#8216;<em>a gnawing at his soul</em>.&#8217; I remarked that he
was very young to be tired of life; that if he had been guilty of any crime he should
desire to live to expiate it. &#8216;No,&#8217; he replied, &#8216;the stain will always last!&#8217; I told him, not
so; that if he heartily repented and turned to the right source for consolation, it would be
vouchsafed him. &#8216;I feel that I cannot live,&#8217; he replied, &#8216;and my friends will be better satisfied
to know that I am repentant in my last moments, and that I am gone, than they
would be to think of me as a vagabond, let loose upon society: they will at least feel that
I shall &#8216;cease from troubling.&#8217; I have not the excuse that many delinquents have pleaded,
early initiation into vice. My childhood was passed with pious relatives, who labored
to instil religious principles into my mind; but I &#8216;would none of their reproof.&#8217; My friends
not being wealthy, I was left at a proper age to my own resources. I found a situation
where my talents were appreciated by my employer, and perhaps too highly estimated by
myself. I had a brother who was ten years my senior, whom I loved and esteemed&#8212;may
Heaven keep him in blessed ignorance of my fate!&#8212;but I thought less highly of his intellect
when I saw him excited by some sublime hymn, which angels might listen to, than I
did of my own, when I turned from the devotions of the Sabbath to join my idle companions.
In the situation I held, I might have gained respectability; but my besetting sin
betrayed me so often, that the kind indulgence of a good master could no longer conceal
my crimes. I now see that the sting inflicted by vice must and <em>will</em> remain! We may repent,
we may be forgiven; but the mind will not part with its bitter recollections!&#8217; I was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page100" name="page100"></a>100</span>here called away for a few moments, and when I returned, the unhappy young man was
in the land of spirits! I learned that he was engaged to a highly amiable young lady, who
relinquished him, and shortly afterward died of a broken heart. <em>Her</em> sad fate threw him
into a brain-fever, and as you perceive, decided <em>his</em> likewise. Incidents like these I am
aware have often been narrated; yet if the tragedy which I have depicted should be
blessed to the use of any young man abandoned to temptation and addicted to small crimes,
and lead him to reflection, it will be a gratification to feel that my feeble effort, with Heaven&#8217;s
help, has proved &#8216;a word in season.&#8217;&#8217;  <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">There</span> are inequalities of merit in the &#8216;<i>Dirge</i>&#8217;

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Yet not all blank and desolate</p>
<p>Was this poor man&#8217;s earthly state;</p>
<p>Hope, toil, content, can soften fate,</p>
<p class="i6">As the moss the rock.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">

<p>It is a sad sight to look upon the corpse of a laborer, cut down in the midst of a toilsome
life; his hard, knotty hands clasped upon the still breast, and the strong limbs laid in
serene repose. And yet how happy the change! No longer does he ask leave to toil; no
longer is he at war with poverty, for death has made it a drawn battle. He &#8216;rests from
his labors&#8217; where the rich and the poor meet together, and he hears no more the voice of
the oppressor. <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">Perhaps</span> our readers will have observed that the <i>Sketches of East
Florida</i> are from no common pen. The description which has been given by the writer, of
the delicious climate in that sunny region, may to many &#8216;Northeners&#8217; seem exaggerated;
but such is not the fact. A friend writing recently from St. Augustine, thus playfully
alludes to the effect which the climate produces upon a New-Yorker: &#8216;If a business-man
could be caught up from the whirl of Broadway, and dropped in a warm climate, say that
of St. Augustine, and left under a fig-tree to his own reflections, his first thought doubtless
would be for an omnibus &#8216;right up.&#8217; &#8216;Rather queer!&#8217; he would say; &#8216;a hot sun, sandy
street, and not a carriage to be seen! There&#8217;s a man out in his slippers, and a woman
with her head tied up in a handkerchief&#8212;may-be a night-cap; probably some old Dutch
settlers that went to-sleep with <span class="special_name">Rip Van Winkle</span>. Wild turkeys, as I live, all about the
market!&#8212;and oh, <span class="special_name">Lord</span>! there&#8217;s a little nigger with only a shirt on! Halloo there! you
little nigger! tell me the way to the Broadway coaches! No coaches? no omnibii? Well,
where&#8217;s your five-o&#8217;clock boats?&#8212;where&#8217;s your Harlaem rail-road? I want to go back
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page101" name="page101"></a>101</span>to town!&#8217; Such would probably be his first go-off; and the next impulse would be to run,
shout, cry fire! or murder!&#8212;any thing to produce a sensation; but unless very soon about
it, he would find himself yielding to some strange influence hitherto unfelt; and it would be
amusing to notice how soon the fretting restless man of the forty-second latitude would be
tamed down in the thirteenth to the equanimity of a child asleep. The climate enters
within the man, and brings out one by one some hidden and better impulse, at the same
time laying a gentle hand upon his rougher humors; so that when he would shout, he hums,
and when he would laugh, he smiles only; and in undertaking to run, he is caught about
the waist; and goes floating smoothly around in the ground-swell motion of the Spanish-dance.&#8217;
<span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">We</span> perceive that the <em>Copy-right Question</em> has been thus early brought
before the National Legislature. From the present aspect of things we may indulge a
well-grounded hope that authors who have worn themselves out in making other people
happy, will not hereafter be left to perish amidst age and infirmity, unrelieved by the fruit
of their labors. There is one argument exceedingly well illustrated in the recent address
of the &#8216;Copy-right Club.&#8217; In allusion to the floods of trash which have for months inundated
the Atlantic cities and towns, the writer, addressing himself to American citizens,
observes: &#8216;In all other circumstances and questions save that of a literature, you have
taken the high ground of freedom and self-reliance. You have neither asked, nor loaned,
nor besought, but with your own hands have framed, what the occasion required. Whatever
stature you have grown to as a nation, it is due to that sole virtue; and by its exercise
may you only hope to hold your place. In almost any other shape than that of silent books
you would have spurned the foreign and held fast to the home-born; but stealing in quietly
at every opening, making themselves the seemingly inoffensive and unobtrusive lodgers in
every house, they have full possession of the country in all its parts; and another people
may promise themselves in the next generation of Americans, (as the question now goes,)
a restored dominion which their arms were not able to keep. The pamphlet will carry the
day where the soldier fell back.&#8217; <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">We</span> derive the annexed stanzas through a Boston correspondent.

in the United States</i>. Without any question, the Americans are, in respect of that branch
of science, behind no nation or people on earth. And yet no longer ago than 1791, a
clock-maker from London, after public advertisement of his arrival from England for that
purpose, visited our scattered cities and towns to repair clocks! &#8216;Yankee ingenuity&#8217; was
not then as now synonymous with the accomplishment of <em>any</em> thing that can either be fabricated
or &#8216;fixed&#8217;. <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">We</span> have no remembrance of the communication referred to in a
note from a correspondent at Albany, in which we find the following sentences: &#8216;If received,
I hope it was not amenable to the censure in a late number of the <span class="special_name">Knickerbocker</span>,
of certain correspondence, for having been written &#8216;too carefully.&#8217; Now I do flatter myself
upon so <em>writing</em>, that compositors can have no excuse for blunders, though I am well
aware that to be esteemed a Genious, one&#8217;s chirography should very nearly approach unintelligibility.
If this be true, the patience and good nature of an Editor must be severely
tried; but I incline to the opinion that a man of Genious need not model after <span class="special_name">Byron</span>&#8217;s facsimile,&#8217;
and so forth. Our correspondent <em>does</em> write a good hand; so good indeed, that we
lament, as we gaze at it, that he does not know how to <em>spell</em>. A man may certainly be a
&#8216;<em>Genious</em>&#8217; without being able to write a clerkly hand; but a man who is <em>not</em> a &#8216;Genious,&#8217;
ought at least to be able to spell the word. As to writing &#8216;too carefully,&#8217; our censor has
mistaken the letter for the spirit of our remarks. <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">The</span> lines &#8216;<i>To my Mother</i>&#8217; are
replete with the poetry of <em>feeling</em>. Their literary execution however is marred by deficiencies,

true poetical vein; and we shall not despair of hearing from her again. <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">A very</span>
&#8216;inquiring&#8217; correspondent desires to know &#8216;whether there is any thing below a <i>quartette</i>, in

time somebody had a sight of somebody&#8217;s money.&#8217; <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">A new</span> style of frames for
drawings, engravings, paintings, looking-glasses, etc., has recently been brought to great
perfection, and into very general favor, by Mr. <span class="special_name">Weiser</span>, at No. 43 Centre-street, near Pearl.
They are composed externally of <em>glass-veneerings</em>, beautifully painted and shaded, so as to
resemble different-tinted woods, tortoise-shell, or indeed any other colors that may be desired.
These are painted on the inner side of the glass, which is so firmly cemented to
the wood-frames as to be little liable to injury from jarring or even falling. With a gilt
beading, they have a very beautiful appearance, by reason of the admirable lustre of the
glass, which gives to them a polish finer than that of the most susceptible woods. They
are, in short, exceedingly handsome, easily kept clean, always new and fresh, and what is
worthy of mention, much cheaper than wood or gilt.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
